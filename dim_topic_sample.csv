 'kalshi post only is not an order attribute it is an execution attribute once the order is on the book it makes no difference if it was post only or not so we do not store it you are right though that amend order does not take in the post only flag this is because post only on amend would create some inherent ambiguity would you expect a crossing order to cancel the amended order or to leave it as is'
 'if i understand correctly the only scenario in which an amendorder could result in immediate execution is if you re modifying the price and it crosses the bid ask spread if you re updating price away from the spread or keeping the same price and just updating qty amendorder should always result in a resting order so the cancel recreate workaround which i think is slightly racy if the market shifts between the two calls should only be necessary when increasing bid or decreasing ask price']",True,True,False,Order Modification Issues

 'it s wildly misleading that kalshi has linked to a source in the about section of h n market to a credible texas report showing over specific h n cases and yet those don t count because they aren t on the past global infections cdc page that is the entity verification a reasonable person would heavily bet yes without realizing that the real contract here is whether or not the cdc will update a past infection page for by the end of the year this needs a green box in the least or better just close the contract and refund people i know that kalshi is also aware that there is a troll in the comment section sagacious on that market attempting to manipulate the price by spamming this market across kalshi and amplifying the disqualified information the over h n infections from the kalshi texas link and the over h nx infections from the cdc that he knows are disqualified in order to drive down the price of no'
 'scroll up i pointed out to kalshi that the top graphic h n is confusing on a cdc current infection page that kalshi has decided is generic for h and does not resolve the contract the link in the full rules goes to a broken cdc page and not the actual page that will resolve the market also confusing is the actual entity that matters is a cdc page labeled past global infections to resolve a current year question in the us only also confusing is the link kalshi provided in the summary leads to a texas page that clearly says there are more than h n infections in the us in kalshi needs to clarify this confusion with a green box or simply refund this market and close it fwiw not all highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai are h not all h are h n plenty of humans have died from the other hpai bird flus humans have also been infected and died in asia with h n the terms are not interchangeable it s reasonable to assume that all these us infections are indeed h n because that s what the us chickens and cows all have i agree it s absolutely misleading that the graphic at the top of the cdc current infection page says h n and yet that page doesn t resolve the market apparently because the text doesn t specify h n that s not a distinction that it s reasonable to make and i think crosses a legal line i lost money betting on yes because the rules were unclear']",True,True,False,Kalshi Market Confusion
