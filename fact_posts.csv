There are a lot variables in that type of situation - the level of uncertainty in the market; the ability to spread risk to exit; and the expected chance to exit positions later (to name a few).  Volume incentives won‚Äôt solve for this perfectly.

.notpikachu,2024-12-19,"Just to throw my opinion in, all previous exchanges Ive traded on have an incentive for market makers, whether they are prediction markets or not. Kalshi even has a page on why market makers are neccesary for a healthy and functioning market place https://help.kalshi.com/faq/what-is-the-market-maker-program. Whether or not the volume incentive program is the perfect way to do it or not Im not sure, but I do think having *something* rather than nothing is extremely important. Im sure Kalshi wont be the only prediction market available in the US (not counting predictit cause it sucks) for very long and Kalshi should take advantage of being first to market and solidify its position. A volume incentive program allows 0 margin trades (or even slightly negative ones) to be valid, given Kalshi's high fees this (or some alternative) seems necessary for its long term growth and Kalshi's spreads will never be as competitive as a market with an incentive without one.",Kalshi,0,0.8246
brunobowser,2024-12-19,"A couple things:

Kalshi does have a market maker program.  It is pretty in depth and from what I have seen provides some decent benefits to market makers while putting a lot of requirements on them.  To my knowledge only SIG is enrolled now (maybe KT but I am guessing no since they already have the health of the exchange as their overall goal and don‚Äôt need to be in a special program).  Not saying the market maker program is really open to all (need deep pockets) but want to note it is there.


As to the 0 margin or negative margin trades, that is something that did occur with the previous program but it ultimately led to behaviors that did not move the exchange forward.  If that is the direction you really think it should go in, I would say don‚Äôt hold your breath - it was tried and found to be flawed to pay that deep.  Also, from a regulatory aspect it is behavior that, from the outside, looks very similar to wash trading (not saying it is, just perception).  Other exchanges tend to operate outside of regulatory purview.


Lastly, I think everyone should be cognizant that any of these incentive programs are almost always intended as temporary programs.  So, they are intended to go away - eventually the argument that the other exchange offers it will hold much less water as that reference will be limited to exchanges that are much less successful and/or have much less volume.",Kalshi,0,-0.5089
brunobowser,2024-12-19,"All that being said, I would welcome a new volume incentive program.  I don‚Äôt have the highest hopes at this point but do feel there is a higher likelihood of a flattening of fees.",Kalshi,0,0.5647
brunobowser,2024-12-19,"Also, I share my viewpoint not to discount what is being said but rather to put the arguments into perspective of how the previous program performed and some of the considerations that Kalshi may need to make (in no way do I know their thinking on this but given I have dealt heavily in incentive programs in regulated financial services, I am generally aware of considerations that need to be made).  Hopefully my viewpoint will help to better craft arguments to get a return of the incentive program",Kalshi,0,0.8462

brunobowser,2024-12-20,"I don‚Äôt think it would be meant to encourage people to be takers who are primarily makers right now.

adammurabito,2024-12-20,I get that.. but it feels like there are a lack of takers due to those high fees. so people like me only want to market make and never take unless absolutely necessary,Kalshi,0,0.6616
brunobowser,2024-12-20,"I kind of agree with your point but also would say that both makers and takers are needed in any market.  There needs to be a strong incentive to being a maker (eg no fees) and there are some higher inherent risks on the maker side (eg the underlying changes before you can remove offers).  So, lowering fees too much could drive away much needed makers to become takers and that would really stagnate the markets.  I think most exchanges struggle more on getting the maker side trades in than the taker side so there is probably not much of an incentive to flip those since, while not necessarily a zero sum game, there are finite resources available to most traders and that could mean lowering the maker liquidity overall.  It‚Äôs a tough juggle.

Overall pretty interesting - the one issue is that it is a variable pot and is a percentage of the pot based on volume.  While that makes sense at face value, it inevitably leads to upset traders.

https://learn.polymarket.com/docs/guides/trading/how-are-prices-calculated#how-are-prices-calculated

when does this ""phase"" end? for example, one bettor would put up a buy order for YES at 30c, then another would put up a buy order for NO at 70c. these two are ""matched"", the shares go to each person, and 30/70 becomes the initial price

let's say neither of these bettors want to sell their shares for any price. does it wait for another YES and NO to ""match""? 

at what point does a ""buy YES at $X"" stop getting matched with ""buy NO at $1-X"", and only get matched with ""sell YES at $X""? or in other words, does this ""matching"" ever stop? how many shares need to be owned or how much activity has to happen for it to stop?

or am i misunderstanding entirely?",Polymarket,0,-0.296

https://polymarket.com/event/who-will-be-inaugurated-as-president?tid=1731388232928

The reason is that it could potentially disrupt global peace and order.

Allowing individuals with extraordinary powers or those who have nothing to lose‚Äîwho fall outside the scope of modern legal systems‚Äîto participate in betting combined with real-world actions could enable them to gain profit.

The most dangerous outcome would be the assassination of Trump.

Question/Clarification:   Does this include advisory committees?

There are multiple types of these committees/councils/boards.

Those advisory boards themselves are part part of the government, as the government funds the admin staff, and files the paperwork to create the board,  but the outside advisors are not truly part of the govt as they are outsiders.

Market:
Pennsylvania Margin of Victory

Clarification Request: 
Is there rounding involved w the percentage after the calculation is performed? Ex: Trump 50.5999% - Kamala 48.50% =  Trump 2.0999%

So does this resolve as Trump 2.0% or Trump 2.1% ?

Description:
This market will resolve to ""Yes‚Äù if the Republican Party candidate wins the popular vote in Pennsylvania in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election by between 2.0% (inclusive) and 2.5% (exclusive) when compared with the second place candidate. Otherwise, this market will resolve to ""No"".

For the purpose of resolving this market, the 'margin of victory' is defined as the absolute difference between the percentages of votes received by the Republican Party candidate and the second-place candidate. Percentages of the votes received by each party will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each of the top two candidates receives by the sum of all votes cast in Pennsylvania for the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.

This market will resolve based off the official vote count once Pennsylvania has certified the vote.

If a recount is initiated before certification, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is certified. If a recount occurs after certification, the recount will not be considered.

Clarification Request

Market:
Pennsylvania Margin of Victory

Clarification Request: 
Is there rounding involved w the percentage after the calculation is performed? Ex: Trump 50.5999% - Kamala 48.50% =  Trump 2.0999%

So does this resolve as Trump 2.0% (no rounding) or Trump 2.1% (rounding)?

Part 1

YES holders need to show that there was an Iranian nuclear facility was present at the Taleghan 2 location on 10/28. There is obivously a very high burden of proof, given the geopolitical consequences, which is why it was trading at 90c NO before the Axios article. We're not talking about some small potatoes here.

So far, the ""evidence"" is:

(A) 1 Axios article with original reporting and a plethora of other MSM articles that cite the same Axios article. This is not ""a consensus of credible reporting,"" This is one news organization's claim and dozens of others parroting the same information to show that they have a ""scoop.""

(A) 1 Axios article with original reporting and a plethora of other MSM articles that cite the same Axios article.

Not looking to argue either way just trying to be informed on my bets here (very high possibility of coming down to these votes). Arguments as I've synthesized them from the comments flame war:

* **Should include** - US Elections Atlas officially reports these votes on their site as ""Other"", and therefore should be included in 3P. Considering the spirit of the market, Nevada does not offer a write-in option, so this effectively serves as Nevada's substitute for voters who are in fact voting, just not for any of the provided options (implying their voting for ***another*** option e.g. 3rd party).

* **Should exclude** - Voting for ""None of these Candidates"" means just that, these votes should not be counted towards the numerator or denominator in this calculation. They aren't votes cast ***for*** a third party candidate, the selection of ""None of these Candidates"" effectively equates to a blank ballot. The terms of the market define a 3rd party candidate as ""Third-party candidates refer to any candidates not running as a Democrat or Republican, including candidates running as independents,"" a vote for no candidate does not meet the criteria of this definition, and should therefore be discarded.",Polymarket,0,0.9279

Contrary to many sources, conflict is still happening in Lebanon. How is that a ceasefire.

The rules state that fighting must cease between Hezbollah and Israel in ALL THEATERS. This includes Syria where Hezbollah continue to fight Israel. **Syria is not mentioned in any of the sources as heading towards peace between Hezbollah and Israel.** This IS required to have a Yes resolution.

I get the credible sources argument but read the sources. Also look into middle eastern sources. The correct reporting is that the agreement is between Lebanon and Israel (see some of agreement here https://www.lbcgroup.tv/uploadImages/ExtImages/Images2/Agreement%20English.pdf and check who is mentioned in the first paragraph). Hezbollah is not part of the agreement.

Hezbollah did not announce in any media that they **accepted the ceasefire.** The only people saying they did are western and Israli aligned outlets. We have only heard from one side of the war. A ceasefire has two parties. Why is Hezbollah quiet?

""Will Israel and Hezbollah Agree to a Ceasefire by December 31st, 2024?""

Introduction:
As of October 31st, 2024, senior US officials are engaged in talks with Israel to broker a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon amid a year-long war. The conflict has resulted in significant civilian casualties on both sides, with recent airstrikes and rocket attacks intensifying tensions. While Lebanon's caretaker prime minister initially expressed optimism for a quick resolution, he later noted that Israel's ongoing escalation does not inspire confidence.

Examples of Headlines That Would Qualify for ""YES"":

""Israel and Hezbollah Agree to Ceasefire, Ending Year-Long Conflict""
""Ceasefire Reached Between Israel and Hezbollah After US Mediation""
""Historic Agreement: Israel and Hezbollah Sign Ceasefire Deal""
""Peace at Last: Israel and Hezbollah Commit to Ceasefire Effective Immediately""

We believe that taking the right action today is not only fair to Poly users but also a huge publicity boost for Poly as well. The alleged ""ceasefire"" deal is not founded and visibly unraveling, and the market's uncertainty is becoming increasingly apparent.
If the global community witnesses Polymarket's transparency and integrity during this period, it will significantly enhance the platform's credibility and trustworthiness. By demonstrating a commitment to fairness and ethical practices, Polymarket can position itself as a reliable and forward-thinking predictive market not only for its users but also for people worldwide.

sysiphos91,2024-11-29,"Asked ChatGPT to be an impartial Judge: Upon reviewing the available information, it appears that Hezbollah has not issued a direct, public statement explicitly announcing its acceptance of the ceasefire agreement with Israel. The group's position has been communicated indirectly through Lebanese government officials and intermediaries.  Key Points:      Indirect Communication: Hezbollah's stance on the ceasefire has been conveyed via Lebanese officials, such as Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, who negotiated with U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein with Hezbollah's backing. Additionally, Prime Minister Najib Mikati expressed support for the agreement, urging its immediate implementation to halt hostilities.     Wikipedia      Lack of Direct Statement: There is no record of a direct, official statement from Hezbollah's leadership explicitly announcing the ceasefire agreement. The group's approval has been inferred from the actions and statements of Lebanese government representatives.  Implications for Polymarket Resolution:  The Polymarket rules stipulate that both Israel and Hezbollah must officially announce a ceasefire through their respective official channels for the market to resolve to ""Yes."" Given the absence of a direct and explicit announcement from Hezbollah, this condition has not been fully satisfied.  Conclusion:  Based on the available information and the specific requirements outlined in the Polymarket rules, the market should resolve to ""No."" The lack of a direct official announcement from Hezbollah means that the criteria for a ""Yes"" resolution have not been met.",Polymarket,0,0.9662

Rather than viewing deformity and disability as negative attributes, this imagery invites us to celebrate the unique stories and experiences that come with them. Just as a deflated balloon retains its vibrant colors and playful spirit, individuals with disabilities often embody strength, creativity, and adaptability in the face of challenges. This perspective encourages a shift in societal attitudes, promoting inclusivity and appreciation for diversity. By embracing the deflated hand as a positive representation, we can foster a deeper understanding of the richness that comes from our differences, ultimately enriching the tapestry of human experience.",Polymarket,25,0.991

Markets On Polymarket have clear Guidelines.

Markets are resolved according to the rules set forth on the market page
The rules specify the resolution source, the market end date, and they outline how the market should resolve in various edge-cases.
The markets title describes the market, but the rules define how it should be resolved.
It is important to read the rules before trading in a market.
Polymarket themselves state in their guidelines that the title does not matter‚Ä¶ the clear rules of the market matter and you should bet according to the rules!


However as we know Polymarket has uploaded an additional context stating: 
‚ÄúA broad and credible media consensus has confirmed an Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire, agreed to by both sides, went into effect on November 27 at 4AM local time. Thus, this market should resolve to ""Yes"".‚Äù
This additional context is the ONLY reasoning the Yes holders have for their Vote on Yes. 

However the Polymarket Guidelines have explicit clarifications for the use of additional context.

‚ÄúClarifications‚Äù
‚ÄúIn rare cases, circumstances occur that were not foreseen at a market's creation and it becomes necessary to clarify rules after trading has begun. In these cases Polymarket may issue an ‚ÄúAdditional context‚Äù update on the rules.‚Äù

likestarlikesun,2024-12-03,"Dear Polymarket Team,



I hope this message finds you well.



I am a participant in the ‚ÄúElon Musk # of tweets Nov 29-Dec 6‚Äù market on your platform. During my participation, I have noticed issues with missing counts in Xtracker data and ambiguities in the rule descriptions. These issues have already sparked widespread discussions among users about the fairness of the market. To ensure the transparency and integrity of the market, I am submitting this feedback and requesting an update on the missing counts.



Issues with Missing Counts in Xtracker



Based on Xtracker‚Äôs current data, it appears that some posts have not been recorded, which could directly affect the outcome of the market. Specifically:

    ‚Ä¢    Missing Counts: Approximately 13 posts seem to be missing, most of which occurred yesterday afternoon and evening.

    ‚Ä¢    Examples of Missing Tweets:

    ‚Ä¢    https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1863383648831172905

    ‚Ä¢    https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1863365002109108655

    ‚Ä¢    https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1863366484447384061



These tweets appear to meet the market rules (main feed posts, quote posts, reposts, etc.) but have not been included in the count. This discrepancy has already led to significant discussions among users, with some raising concerns about the fairness of the market. I urge you to investigate the issue and update the missing counts as soon as possible.



Questions About Rule Descriptions



The market rules state: ‚ÄúIf the tracker does not update correctly in accordance with the rules, X itself may be used as a secondary resolution source.‚Äù However, this raises the following questions:

    ‚Ä¢    Unclear Conditions: Under what circumstances will X be used as a secondary resolution source? What are the criteria for this decision?

    ‚Ä¢    Logical Consistency: If X is used as a resolution source, will its logic align with that of the current tracker?



Looking forward to your reply!

First of all, thank you for taking the time to respond. Please excuse the question, but are you officially affiliated with Polymarket?

I‚Äôd like to clarify that I fully understand what is meant by write-ins and why official reports often don‚Äôt include them. Take the example of Batman and Robin not being counted‚Äîit makes sense. However, I‚Äôd like to refer back to the sources I provided. There is a difference of about 8,000 write-ins between Reuters and Dave‚Äôs data in Texas. On the official Texas state website, there is no mention of this anywhere, not even at the county level.

On Dave‚Äôs site, for example in Brewster County, there are no source references provided. While I respect Dave‚Äôs work, I believe it is crucial to at least specify where the data is coming from. Regardless of whether the market resolves to Yes or No, I want to encourage a broader perspective where multiple independent sources are considered, rather than relying on just one. Relying on a single source only encourages manipulation.

‚ÄúIn parallel, Israeli forces have seized military posts in southern Syria, beyond a U.N.-monitored buffer zone.‚Äù
""The goal, said Avi Dichter, an Israeli minister ‚Ä¶ 'is to establish facts on the ground.'‚Äù
Not just airstrikes or temporary raids. Explicit objective to hold territory and influence the situation on the ground.

‚ÄúIn recent days, Israeli ground forces have crossed the border from the occupied Golan Heights into a previously demilitarised buffer zone inside Syria, seizing abandoned Syrian army positions.‚Äù
Confirms shift from defensive to proactively seizing positions in Syria.

BBC, 11th:

Lasting, acknowledged presence outside the Golan Heights.

IDF, 11th:
‚ÄúThe forces of the 474th Brigade Combat Team continue to operate at control points in the buffer zone ... [and] confiscated a number of unused Syrian tanks.‚Äù

A large-scale operation coupled with troops stationed inside the territory.

Telegraph, 11th:
‚ÄúIsraeli troops have taken control of areas inside Syria beyond the Golan Heights and launched extensive strikes, securing strategic territory.‚Äù

NYT, 12th:
‚ÄúBut soldiers have also taken up positions deeper inside Syrian territory, according to Israeli officials.‚Äù
Israeli forces have moved well beyond the previously recognized boundaries.

Evidence past the Golan Heights:

Washington Post, 12th:
‚Äú‚Ä¶seized military posts in southern Syria, beyond a U.N.-monitored buffer zone.‚Äù
The UN-monitored buffer zone is not considered part of the Golan Heights. Operating beyond is in internationally recognized Syrian territory.

BBC, 11th:
‚Äú‚Ä¶moved ground forces east from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights into a demilitarised buffer zone in Syria and ‚Ä¶ just beyond.‚Äù
Moving east beyond the Golan and the buffer zone confirms they are now on Syrian soil

Financial Times, 10th:
‚Äú‚Ä¶crossed the border from the occupied Golan Heights into a previously demilitarised buffer zone inside Syria‚Ä¶‚Äù
The demilitarized buffer zone and beyond it lie within Syria, not within what Israel claims as Golan territory

NYT, 12th:
‚ÄúThe Israeli military has mostly deployed in a 155-square-mile zone that was intended to be a demilitarized area ‚Ä¶ But soldiers have also taken up positions deeper inside Syrian territory‚Ä¶‚Äù

IMO, the best and fairest solution here is to:     
1) Instruct UMA that the Final vote on 12/31 should be unburdened from what has been -  voters should vote what they actually believe is the correct answer to the question,  not vote towards what they think everyone else will vote so that they can get rewards and not be slashed.

2). You should also ask the 2 big Umans that vote the 5 accounts with 1million+ tokens to not cast a vote.   
- I believe this would result in a non-quorum vote, which means there would be No Uma voters that would get slashed for a non-consensus vote.    
- This also democratizes the process since the 2 whale votes are largely outcome determinative (when they vote together takes like 90% of everyone else to overrule them).


Consistency is the ONLY thing that matters from an Oracle - Users can generally predict how Uma will resolve and how Poly will resolve.   They cannot predict IF and WHEN Polymarket is going to intervene with a clarification.   This is is already an issue, nobody knows why or when poly is going to clarify.  We are 2 weeks into a dispute here and poly has never clarified this late.     We at least thought we knew that once something was sent to UMA for several weeks, there would be no clarification forthcoming from Poly.   

Polymarket ruling in favor of either direction at this late a point in time essentially means users can have 0 expectation as to HOW, WHEN, and WHO will resolve a market.   Users now know nothing -  every market at any time can be changed.  

This will only encourage constant begging and pleading which is what half of the activity is here.

benjaminsturgeon_68159,2024-12-21,"Here's the analysis from wikipedia:

Key passage about what constitutes a shutdown historically:
""Prior to the 1980s, many federal agencies continued to operate during shutdowns, while minimizing all nonessential operations and obligations, believing that Congress did not intend that agencies close down while waiting for the enactment of annual appropriations acts or temporary appropriations.""
And importantly: ""even after the Civiletti opinions, not all funding gaps led to shutdowns. Of the nine funding gaps between 1980 and 1990, only four led to furloughs.""

Now looking at today's situation:

There was a technical funding gap
BUT:

No agencies shut down
No workers were furloughed
The OMB proactively prevented shutdown procedures
Government operations continued

Now let's look at that second line of the rules:
""The market will resolve to ""Yes"" if the acting President fails to sign the relevant bill(s) extending government funding by the applicable deadline(s), even if no government shutdown is explicitly announced.""
The key phrase is ""even if no government shutdown is explicitly announced"" - this suggests the rule is meant to capture situations where a shutdown occurs but isn't officially declared. However, in this case:

It's not that a shutdown wasn't announced
It's that administrative actions were taken to prevent any shutdown from occurring at all

Just like those funding gaps in the 1980s that didn't lead to shutdowns, this appears to be a case where a technical funding gap existed but no actual shutdown occurred - making it more like those 5 out of 9 funding gaps that didn't result in actual shutdowns.

nonfungiblemomo,2024-12-22,"The outcome of the market should be **""No""**, based on the rules and the reported events.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Timing of the Resolution**:
   - The market rules state that the resolution will occur if a shutdown happens between **August 30 and December 31, 2024, at 11:59 PM ET**.
   - As of December 21, 2024, a bill has been signed into law that averts a government shutdown, and federal operations were not closed.
2. **Definition of a Shutdown**:
   - A shutdown requires that **the acting President fails to sign relevant funding bills by the applicable deadlines**, causing federal operations to go unfunded.
   - The news clearly indicates that Congress approved a temporary funding plan after the deadline but in time to avoid any cessation of federal operations. Even if preparations for a shutdown had begun, **no portion of the government actually went unfunded or shut down**.
3. **Source Confirmation**:
   - The rules specify that ""official information from the U.S. government"" or ""a consensus of credible reporting"" will be used to resolve the market.
   - The cited news explicitly states: *""There will be no government shutdown,""* and no evidence contradicts this assertion.
4. **Partial Shutdowns**:
   - The rules account for the possibility of partial shutdowns and clarify that ""any shutdown will count.""
   - However, no portion of the government went unfunded or was explicitly shut down during this period, based on the report.

Since the President signed the funding bill in time to avoid a shutdown and there is no credible evidence of any portion of the government shutting down during the specified period, the market should resolve to **""No""**.",Polymarket,0,-0.9

However, in reality, there was no shutdown at all, and the added rules changed the question from whether the government would shut down to whether it will be signed in time.

rwrybeoso4iknphu,2024-12-22,"The market would not resolve to ""Yes."" Here's why:

    The key factor is that no agencies will shut down, despite the passage of the midnight deadline. This is due to the high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations bill, and President Biden will sign the bill on Saturday.
    Since the market specifies that a ""Yes"" resolution requires a government shutdown, and the statement indicates that the government will not shut down and funding is expected to be extended imminently, this means no shutdown will occur during this period.
    As the statement suggests that the funding issue is on track to be resolved, and there is no indication of a funding gap or partial shutdown, the market would resolve to ""No"" under these circumstances.

In conclusion, based on this specific announcement, the market would resolve to ""No,"" as the threat of a shutdown is being averted with a clear resolution in progress.",Polymarket,0,0.0408

Rule A: The outcome is No
Rule B: The outcome can‚Äôt be YES as no exact deadline specification was included in this rule! In this case, the deadline should be taken from rule A
Rule C: The outcome is No

reddington0821,2024-12-23,"The Reuters report confirms that the U.S. Senate passed the government funding bill 38 minutes after the previous funding expired at midnight on December 20, 2024. Despite this technical delay, no government shutdown occurred, as stated explicitly in the report. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) did not invoke shutdown procedures, and government operations continued without interruption.
This information is critical because it aligns with the market‚Äôs original rules, which rely on official confirmation from the White House or credible reporting to determine whether a shutdown occurred. Since the White House confirmed that President Biden signed the bill into law on December 21, 2024, and no shutdown was reported by credible sources like Reuters, this strongly supports a resolution of the market as P4 (‚ÄúToo Early‚Äù).
Key Points:
    1.    No Shutdown Occurred: The OMB explicitly avoided shutdown procedures despite the Senate‚Äôs late vote. Government operations continued uninterrupted.
    2.    Primary Source Rule: The White House and credible media confirm that no shutdown occurred, fulfilling the market‚Äôs reliance on official sources.
    3.    Premature Resolution Risk: Resolving as ‚ÄúYes‚Äù (P2) is incorrect because no shutdown happened. Resolving as ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (P1) is premature since the market runs until December 31, 2024.
Conclusion:
Given the absence of a shutdown and the ongoing market period, resolving as P4 (‚ÄúToo Early‚Äù) is the only fair and rule-compliant decision.",Polymarket,0,0.7409

A good site that values long term health where users have no recourse would be generous with refunds in case of rules ambiguities. But Polymarket doesn‚Äôt do that and I think your recourse if you disagree with a resolution here is to eat shit. Until we are trading on 30 page underlying contracts with no ambiguity the lack of recourse for incorrect resolutions is a big issue. I think people in the u.s could pursue legal recourse against Kalshi if they resolved something incorrectly plus there is CFTC oversight.

I went to the UMA discord and they told me that because of the price of the market and the OGs who have put money into no, there is a high chance that this gets pushed to resolution on UMA. They recommended I come here to get a clarification from PM regarding this.

It's obviously clear by the way the rules are written, that this is meant to be a bet on if Luigi's ""first plea"" for any of his charges are guilty. People are attempting to resolve it based on his pleas for the NY state charges without even letting the pleas for the Federal charges happen.

The argument they are trying to make is that it has already been the ""first arraignment""

However, the rules do not say only the ""first arraignment"" counts. The rules say ""first pleas for the arraignment"". First pleas always happen during the arraignment, but the federal arraignment hasn't even happened yet. How can we resolve this market when literally half the charges haven't had a plea yet?

How do I get PM attention so that they can issue a clarification on the matter. Technically the ""first arraignment"" happened in PA so if the interpretation of the market was the first arraignment, that happened earlier this month. Suddenly deciding the rules meant ""first arraignment"" and not ""first plea"" as it clearly states - and then simultaneously deciding that it is the NY arraignment that counts as the first but not the PA one seems to make no sense at all.

Clearly the only logical way this make sense is if the market is asking about the ""first plea"" for each charge.

However, they constantly **delay updating** this same counter. They forget to update it and update a while afterwards. So suppose their counter is at 199, but it's actually 201 losses, and they win at ""199"", but after their win, they update the counter to 201. What happens here? 199 is YES, because the counter was showing 199 regardless of the revision that follows it?

> In the context of electing a Speaker (e.g., for the U.S. House of Representatives), multiple ballots simply mean that no candidate has yet received the majority of votes required to be elected Speaker in a given round of voting. It doesn't necessarily mean someone is no longer the Speaker, but rather that the election is ongoing because consensus has not been reached.

> Here‚Äôs how it works:
> 
> One Ballot (Single Round): If a candidate receives the required majority of votes on the first ballot, they are elected Speaker immediately, and no further ballots are needed.
> 
> Multiple Ballots: If no candidate receives a majority in the first round, the process continues with additional rounds (or ballots) of voting until a candidate secures the majority. This can occur due to divided votes, negotiations, or shifting alliances among voting members.

albertlt,2025-01-06,"I asked chatgpt and this is the response:

No, the leader of a political party in Canada is not automatically the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is typically the leader of the political party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons during a federal election, but there are some nuances:

Key Points:

Winning the Most Seats:

The leader of the party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons is usually invited by the Governor General to form the government and becomes the Prime Minister.
However, it is the confidence of the House of Commons that ultimately determines who remains Prime Minister.
Majority vs. Minority Government:

In a majority government, where one party wins more than half the seats, the party leader becomes the Prime Minister.
In a minority government, the leader of the party with the most seats usually becomes the Prime Minister, but they need the support of other parties to maintain confidence in the House.

Incumbency:

If the current Prime Minister's party does not win the most seats but no other party can form a government with majority support in the House, the incumbent Prime Minister may remain in office.
Leadership Transitions:

If a sitting Prime Minister steps down or is replaced as the leader of their party, the new party leader does not automatically become Prime Minister. The Governor General will decide if the new leader has the confidence of the House.

Examples of Exceptions:

Kim Campbell (1993): She became Prime Minister after replacing Brian Mulroney as the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, not through a general election but through a leadership contest within her party.

John Turner (1984): He became Prime Minister after Pierre Trudeau resigned as the leader of the Liberal Party.

In summary, while the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the governing party, it is not guaranteed, and their position depends on maintaining the confidence of the House of Commons.",Polymarket,0,0.9975

Tl;dr: Negative risk is a significant improvement in terms of capital efficiency for single-winner events. Previously, for events with a single winner, owning No shares in many of the underlying outcomes meant locking up lots of capital when in reality your max loss was actually quite limited. Take for example an event with 3 options A, B, C in which only outcome can win. Imagine you own No A and No B. Since the market is a single winner market (A and B can‚Äôt both win), at least one of your shares must become worth $1: 

-If A wins, No B will be worth a dollar
-If B wins, No A will be worth a dollar
-If neither A nor B win, both No A and No B are worth a dollar.

So, in the worst case scenario, you will gain money on at least one of your outcome shares. Instead of gaining that money when the market resolves, you can now be credited that money to use immediately by clicking convert next to your respective position.  When converting No A + No B you will receive USDC and Yes C shares.",Polymarket,0,0.9933

tr00he,2024-11-15,"**Request: Modify portfolio value calculation.**

Something that has been bothering me for a while is the way the portfolio value is calculated. It seems that the portfolio value is based on the average between the lowest sell price and the highest bid in the order books. This inflates the displayed portfolio value, as it does not reflect the actual amount of money you would receive when selling your positions. 
In reality, when you sell off your bets, you end up with less money than what the portfolio value suggests.

I kindly request that the portfolio value be calculated solely based on the highest bids in the order books, without considering the sell prices. This issue is particularly frustrating when large market orders are placed, as they clear out the entire order book, driving up the average price. This causes a significant, artificial jump in the portfolio value, which does not represent its true worth.

This adjustment should not only apply to the overall portfolio value but also to the calculated value of individual bets.",Polymarket,0,0.8775

I have a proven track record of successfully delivering projects in the web 3 space, ranging from building dApps for decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to implementing secure smart contracts for various use cases.




One of my recent projects involved developing a decentralized voting application on Ethereum, which required implementing smart contracts for transparent and tamper-resistant voting processes. This experience not only strengthened my proficiency in Solidity programming but also deepened my understanding of blockchain governance mechanisms and decentralized consensus algorithms.





In addition to my technical skills, I am adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams, communicating complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, and adapting to the rapidly evolving landscape of web 3 technologies. I thrive in dynamic environments where innovation is encouraged, and I am eager to contribute my expertise to Jup mission.




I am particularly drawn to Jup because of its reputation for [mention specific aspect of the company that interests you, such as its commitment to decentralization, innovative projects, etc.]. I am impressed by the work your team has done in [mention specific project or initiative if applicable], and I am eager to be part of such a forward-thinking organization.

adewotta,2024-11-30,"Steps to reproduce.

1. Have the window set at an aspect ratio that causes the mobile UI to show up
2. Go to a sports market and set a limit order
3. Set the number of shares, set the limit price, and then realize you chose the wrong team
4. Press the button at the top left that switches the teams
5. See that ""To win"", ""limit price"", and ""shares"" all stay the same

Now you can do one of two things
1. Click buy, and it will charge you the incorrect price, so if you put in an order at 10 cents per share, it might charge 80 cents per share instead.

Or

1. Click the increment/decrement button
2. The price will immediately jump to the opposing value.

adewotta,2024-11-30,"tysm!
Also I figure it is worth asking, does Polymarket have a bug bounty, and if so would this be impactful enough that it could qualify for a low impact bounty? I'd assume this where polyMarket doesn't update the UI with the correct price info on the order screen, and using the incorrect price when placing the order might qualify, or might at least be near the edge of qualifying.

Also, when testing the bug and recording that video,  I realized you don't need to increment/decrement the value to be charged the wrong value, it will just happen. Incrementing/decrementing just changes the UI. It will still say 10 cents but charge you the wrong one if you don't mess with those two buttons",Polymarket,0,-0.8151

I have some questions with respect to neg-risk markets. I sent my questions to the customer support via the website over a week ago but it still says the message is unread.

If I convert and immediately sell all my positions, will I still receive yes shares if outcomes get added in the future? 
Also if I own yes shares of the option ""Other"" in a neg-risk market, will I also receive the equal amount of yes shares for outcomes added in the future? Or if I own no shares of the option ""Other"", will I get no shares for the newly added outcomes?

```
This market will resolve to ""Yes"" if the U.S government shut down occurs between August 30, and December 31, 2024, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to ""No"".

The market will resolve to ‚ÄúYes‚Äù if the acting President fails to sign the relevant bill(s) extending government funding by the applicable deadline(s), even if no government shutdown is explicitly announced.

For this market to resolve to ""Yes"" any shutdown will count. If only a portion of the US government is covered by any signed bill(s) extending funding of the US government, and a portion of the US government goes unfunded, this market will still resolve to ""Yes"".

The primary resolution for this source will be official information from the US government, however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.

urbancatto,2024-12-28,"Once again, thanks for writing back, just trying to wrap my head around the pipeline here since it's widely encouraged in the crypto space to do-your-own-research. Can't help but feel after carefully reading Polymarket's (PM) docs, that the docs don't, at least for now, provide full clarity on questions about the ownership and control of the funds that are deposited on PM.

To get back on track to our conversation which began with my question regarding the ownership of the private key of a user's PM wallet, you shared that this wallet is a smart contract, and is operated by whoever controls that user's PM account.

> Hey: so, the proxy wallet is actually a smart contract
> It‚Äôs operated by the signer/owner wallet used to login. We don‚Äôt have control of the proxy wallets, access to the funds, nor the owner/signer.

So okay, but PM also has control over the user's PM account.. thus... PM could, if it so desired, operate the wallet on the user's behalf? And, is ""operate a wallet"" not identical to ""control a wallet""?",Polymarket,0,0.9774

I'm trying to swap an amount of a token (on Polygon chain) that I have in my metamask wallet to USDC.e (Polygon) so that I can then use the obtained USDC.e to trade on Polymarket. The usual swap venues like Uniswap have offered great rates for this swap, but they need a small amount of POL token (like less than 10 cents) to pay for the fees for this swap (e.g., to pay for gas fee).

I thought Uniswap could just deduct whatever POL amount is needed for gas fees to accomplish the swap, but it said I needed to have POL tokens before any swap could be initiated. 

Problem is, I don't have POL and don't know how to buy POL without going through the painful KYC process of signing up with an exchange to buy POL with fiat. 

I tried to swap some of my token for obtain POL but Uniswap says that I need some POL to swap for POL, so a catch-22 situation here.",Polymarket,0,0.3612

Overview

Fees are levied in the output asset (proceeds). Fees for binary options with a complementary relationship (ie A + A' = C) must be symmetric to preserve market integrity. Symmetric means that someone selling 100 shares of A @ $0.99 should pay the same fee value as someone buying 100 A' @ $0.01. An intuition for this requires understanding that minting/merging a complementary token set for collateral can happen at any time. Fees are thus implemented in the following manner.

If buying (ie receiving A or A'), the fee is levied on the proceed tokens. If selling (ie receiving C), the fee is levied on the proceed collateral. The base fee rate (baseFeeRate) is signed into the order struct. The base fee rate corresponds to % the fee rate paid by traders when the price of the two tokens is equal (ie 0.50and

0.50). Moving away from a centered price, the following formulas are used to calculate the fees making sure to maintain symmetry.

Case 1: If selling outcome tokens (base) for collateral (quote):

feeQuote=baseRate‚àómin(price,1‚àíprice)‚àósize

Case 2: If buying outcome tokens (base) with collateral (quote):

feeBase=baseRate‚àómin(price,1‚àíprice)‚àósizeprice

bradkey,2024-11-12,"'m a developer working on integrating the Polymarket API into a Discord bot, and I'm running into a couple of issues that I'm hoping the community can help me with.

Fetching the latest active market:

Based on the Polymarket API documentation, I've tried using the sortBy='updated' and order='desc' parameters to fetch the latest active market.
However, even after increasing the limit to 10,000 markets, the bot is not consistently returning the latest market that is visible on the Polymarket website.
Could the community please provide any guidance or insights on how to reliably fetch the latest active market using the Polymarket API? I'm happy to share the code I've tried if that would be helpful.


Categorizing markets:

The Polymarket API documentation mentions the ability to filter markets by category using the category parameter.
However, when I've tried to use this parameter, the bot has not been able to consistently retrieve markets in the 'crypto' category, even though I can see crypto-related markets on the Polymarket website.
Could the community advise on the best way to categorize markets using the Polymarket API? I'd like to be able to filter markets by category (e.g., crypto, sports, politics) to provide a better user experience in my Discord bot.

hollowgrahm,2024-11-12,"> Some markets are structured like this, e.g. https://polymarket.com/event/who-will-win-white-women?tid=1731312111458, which is a little inconsistent.
Okay yes this is exactly the way I would expect every binary market to be set up.
> Apart from these exceptions, the chosen setup allows for a more balanced / efficient market (very much like public markets & betting markets). Keep in mind it's about predictions. In your example a Trump YES share *implies* Kamala NO but it's not actually the same. You've got to wrap your head around it not in terms of the other options but in terms of YES / NO on a single option.
I think my confusion comes from not understanding why does one market have four options, trying to resolve two different predictions as opposed to splitting the predictions into two separate markets with just two options. Why isn‚Äôt there independent ‚ÄúWho will win election [Trump/Kamala shares]‚Äù and ‚ÄúWho will lose election [Trump/Kamala shares]‚Äù instead of the current four share two prediction setup? (Also disregarding Other/Independent shares for the simplicity of the examples as it‚Äôs arbitrary the number of options in a market to understand the dynamic I‚Äôm describing).

Because I think once you conceptualize the dynamic as this, it makes one of the markets seem redundant, unnecessary, and introducing the problem of liquidity fragmentation.
> Let's look at your example in practice: Trump YES was at ~65% at some point. Now, you could say ""Do I believe Trump has a >=65% chance of winning?"" - if you don't think so, you would buy NO (or sell YES). But you wouldn't buy Kamala YES. Your action then balances the prediction related to Trump. Does that help answering your question?
But if it was just a two option share, Trump/Kamala, and Trump was 65% chance and I didn‚Äôt agree with it, selling Trump or buying Kamala would have the same effect of balancing the prediction related to Trump (and inversely Kamala as well) as the Yes/No example you provided wouldn‚Äôt it?",Polymarket,0,0.899

45trinity,2024-11-24,"Hi, does anyone know what is the exact flow of markets between 1c and 0.1c tick size? 

From my observation the way this is handled, is that markets always start at 1c tick size and once they drop below 6c price at either side there is a event on market channel which transitions the market to 0.1c tick size. 

If after this the market decides the probabilities of the outcome are again above 6c, even 50% the market stays at the 0.1c tick size. 

Put short, markets start 1c tick size, transition to 0.1c tick size once below 6c probability and from there never go back?

luffy8851,2024-11-24,"Hi, team.
I am a full stack and blockchain developer with over 7 years of experience in designing, developing, and deploying dApps, smart contracts, and DeFi protocols. My expertise encompasses both front-end and back-end technologies, allowing me to build seamless user experiences while ensuring robust server-side logic.

I have hands-on experience with major blockchain platforms, including Solana and Ethereum. On Ethereum, I have developed complex smart contracts using Solidity, optimizing for gas efficiency and security. I have successfully deployed several DApps that facilitate token swaps, yield farming, and liquidity provision, contributing to real-world projects that enhance user engagement and streamline financial processes.

In addition to my blockchain proficiency, I am well-versed in modern web technologies such as React, Node.js, and Express, enabling me to create responsive and interactive interfaces. My experience includes working with various databases, including MongoDB and PostgreSQL, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval.

As a full-stack and blockchain developer at 1inch.io, I have contributed to the development of the platform's front-end using Next.js and TypeScript, ensuring a user-friendly interface. 
On the back-end, I have implemented server-side logic with Node.js and Go to handle high transaction volumes efficiently. 
Additionally, I have developed and audited smart contracts in Solidity, which are integral to our protocols like the 1inch Aggregation Protocol and Limit Order Protocol, facilitating secure and efficient token swaps across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

Currently, I am seeking new opportunities in Web3 and blockchain development, where I can leverage my skills to contribute to innovative projects and help drive the future of decentralized technology.

arvid0429,2024-11-26,"edit: 'somehow' fixed it. just browsed polygons git and git issues, i think you need several allowances to trade all events.

Hi guys, I have a quick question with an allowance issue when using CLOB API. For some token IDs (e.g. Will BTC hit 100k in Novmeber - outcome yes) it works just well and I can place an order using the API's function create_order & place_order. 
But for some events, e.g. Brighton vs. Southhampton (token ID for e.g. Draw- yes, 98680452978587690017197865790996313736017409268268892731247810037473667931335), it gives me an error 'py_clob_client.exceptions.PolyApiException: PolyApiException[status_code=400, error_message={'error': 'not enough balance / allowance'}]'.

When I print client.get_balance_allowance() I have an allowance of ~100USDC.e, and my order is 5 shares of 0.15c, and I have around 10$ on the wallet I'm testing. So how come it does not work for some events/token IDs, but works just fine for others? any idea? are there more allowances that I do not know of than for client.get_collateral_address()?

I thought I can use Trades but I don't understand what type of object returned in Trades request, it seems it returns all trading actions I took in my account and there is no clear/straightforward way to transform Trade object into Position.

Please help üôèüèª I feel I stuck",Polymarket,0,0.4541

zigak,2024-12-13,"Hey,
I want to make my first trade on Polymarket via CLOB API.

Using python library I successfuly used `client.create_order` and `client.post_order`, but I have problems with balances and allowances.

I signed up to Polymarket with my gmail account and my Polymarket account starts with: `0x02....`. I sent some USDC to it and also successfully placed a bet via user interface.
Then I went to export private key and it says it will reveal private key for account: `0x98....`. 
Why this address is different from my Polymarket address?
And when I use this private key in my client and try to get balance and allowance with   
```collateral = client.get_balance_allowance(
    params=BalanceAllowanceParams(asset_type=AssetType.COLLATERAL)
)```
I get `{'balance': '0', 'allowances': {'0x4bFb41d5B3570DeFd03C39a9A4D8dE6Bd8B8982E': '0', '0xC5d563A36AE78145C45a50134d48A1215220f80a': '0', '0xd91E80cF2E7be2e162c6513ceD06f1dD0dA35296': '0'}}`

domah,2024-11-15,"alright, so my take here is that i think my reading of the rules is a bit straight forward & unassailable that neither an appointment nor a nomination has happened yet. these are actions that go back to the founding of our country, and are well codified by hundreds of years of this happening. 

my takeaway from this convo is that kalshi's usage of the word ""nomination"" was intended to be more colloquial and less formal. and that this is in line with trump's similarly informal ""nomination"" language despite a nomination def having not happened yet.

where i usually end up here is the title as the tiebreaker -- and the title would seem to fall entirely within the formal reading of the rules. if tulsi is never formally nominated, she would never be in the trump administration, and the answer will forever be NO but will have been expired as YES.",Kalshi,0,0.6652

brunobowser,2024-12-06,Agreed.

megalodon5423,2024-12-07,"When you deposit money at a bank, you expect the bank to give it back to you. There are two things you might worry about, two sets of risks that might prevent the bank from giving you back your money. One, which we talk about a lot around here, and which is pretty central to the history and theory of banking and bank regulation, is that the bank might lose the money. Banks do not generally just keep your money in the vault. They use it to make loans, so there is risk: The loans might default, or depositors might all demand their money back at once when the bank does not have a lot of ready cash.
These kinds of risk are very well understood, there is an extensive literature about them, they‚Äôre in It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life, and bank capital and liquidity regulation and prudential supervision are designed to minimize the risk that a bank will lose your money by investing it poorly. And if things do go wrong, there is an extensive system of government backstops ‚Äî the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation‚Äôs guarantee of bank deposits, etc. ‚Äî to make sure that depositors will get their money anyway.",Kalshi,45,-0.2431
megalodon5423,2024-12-07,"The other risk, which we talk about less, and which is sort of less intellectually interesting, is that the bank might lose track of the money. You might go to the bank and deposit $100, and the bank might write down ‚Äú$100‚Äù next to your name in its notebook, and then it might spill coffee on the notebook and be unable to read the entry and forget that it owes you the $100. And then you might come back to the bank in a week and ask for your $100 back and the bank might say ‚Äúwho are you? what $100?‚Äù And the bank might be totally solvent and have invested your $100 in very safe things, but it won‚Äôt give it back to you because it doesn‚Äôt have a record of you.

This risk is also heavily regulated, though you hear about it less. That regulation is just less controversial. There are material and debatable trade-offs in bank capital and liquidity regulation: A bank with tons of capital will be safer, but it will also have less capacity to lend to the real economy, so there are debates about what the optimal level of capital should be. Whereas with keeping track of the money, there are fewer trade-offs. Banks should entirely keep track of the money. Nobody is lobbying for ‚Äúactually bank ledgers should be a bit more loosey-goosey.‚Äù The proper amount of losing track of the money is none.

And this risk is harder to fix after the fact. If a bank loses all your money, the FDIC can give you your money back, because the FDIC is the government and can print money. If the bank loses its list of who has the money, what can the FDIC do? You can go to the FDIC and say ‚Äúthat bank owes me $100,‚Äù but anyone can say that, whether or not it is true.

It‚Äôs not even a new scam. Have you seen the movie The Sting? The con is that they make people think they are betting on races that are currently happening that are actually already over. This is exactly that same scam Kalshi is running multiple times.

Heres just a few spots that could be considered:

Under Part 38 Core Principle 4 (Prevention of Market Disruption) ¬ß 38.250-251:

The exchange failed in its ""capacity and responsibility to prevent manipulation, price distortion, and disruptions""
Failed to ""monitor and evaluate general market data"" to prevent manipulative activity
Failed to ""demonstrate an effective program for conducting real-time monitoring of market conditions, price movements and volumes""


Under Part 38 Core Principle 12 (Protection of Markets) ¬ß 38.650-651:

Failed to ""protect markets and market participants from abusive practices""
Failed to ""promote fair and equitable trading""
Did not enforce rules ""designed to protect the market and market participants from abusive practices including fraudulent, noncompetitive or unfair actions""


Under Part 180 (Prohibition Against Manipulation) ¬ß 180.1-2:

Violated prohibition against ""manipulative device, scheme, or artifice to defraud"" by allowing trading to continue after resolution data was available
Potentially violated ¬ß 180.1(a)(2) by omitting to state material facts (that resolution data was available) necessary to make trading fair and not misleading
May have violated ¬ß 180.2's prohibition on price manipulation by allowing informed trading against uninformed participants


Under Part 38 Core Principle 7 (Availability of General Information) ¬ß 38.400-401:

Failed obligation to ""make available to market participants accurate information concerning terms and conditions of contracts""
Did not comply with accuracy requirement to provide information that is ""accurate and complete"" and ""not omit material information""

The exchange's failure to close the market as specified in the contract terms while allowing trading to continue after resolution data was available appears as if it could be a serious violation of multiple core principles and anti-manipulation provisions.

fwiw not all Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) are H5 
not all H5 are H5N1.  Plenty of humans have died from the other HPAI bird flus.   Humans have also been infected (and died) in Asia with H5N6.   The terms are not interchangeable.  

It‚Äôs reasonable to assume that  all these US infections are indeed H5N1 because that‚Äôs what the US chickens and cows all have.

unfortunately I think unless Kalshi inherently gives us a trade time order or on event order, then you would have to make that yourself since there are a myriad number of ways to do so

also think about it from crossing the spread perspective... if 10c gets cleared then what happens to the market order if it still has contracts to be executed? does your order get on queue or can it now trade 11c?

The obvious drawback is that if the high temperature just happens to occur after the evening CLI, and the morning CLI thus has a different (but correct) number, settlement would be delayed unnecessarily.

The obvious drawback is that if the high temperature just happens to occur after the evening CLI, and the morning CLI thus has a different (but correct) number, settlement would be delayed unnecessarily. But that's relatively uncommon. I'd personally be fine with that happening once in a while if it meant situations like what happened with Miami the other day could potentially be avoided.

Another idea is to get rid of Miami markets. That sensor has been such a headache.",Kalshi,0,0.1154

Another suggestion is to allow us to delete the SMS Text 2FA even if that means selecting another 2FA method. Literally all 2FA methods are more secure than texting.

mischabear,2024-12-05,"For an unprompted description of how the two work:

1. For the old auth method, you supply your email/password to the login api and get back a token from Kalshi. That token can then be used in subsequent requests to authenticate as you. The disadvantage of something like this is that the actual token being used to authenticate you is being sent to the API for each request, plus you have to hit `/login` before making requests or store the token.

2. For the API key way, you first generate and store the public/private keys on the website. 

When you make a request, you sign the path, timestamp, and HTTP method using the private key. That signature can be verified by Kalshi using the public key (which they do store, they _don't_ store the private key) and they can then know the request came from you. The advantage here is that your private key never gets transmitted, only the _signature_ that you made. Anyone with the public key can validate that the request was signed by your private key.",Kalshi,0,0.4939

Thanks for applying! I'll describe the project a bit more and would love to hear any questions or comments you have. Once we've flushed those out, I'm curious what hours estimate you have here.



Initially, I'm looking for a simple portal to automate trades. There are several automations I'd like to make, but to start, it would be the simplest, an ""opening market order placer"". Kalshi is open from 8:00am ET until 3:00am ET. I need the ability to place a trade before 8a ET and the API will automatically place the order the second the market opens in order to be the first mover. The inputs would be 1) which marker (as identified by the URL and other factors, as there can be several markets with one URL), the offer price, and quantity. For example, at 7a I would place an order for 100 contracts at $.80 and exactly at 8a, it would place that and purchase the shares available.

If there is a strong view one way or another, we can look into implementing the flag there as well, but for now AmendOrder has the same behavior it did before (if the price is amended to cross, the order crosses, regardless of whether the post-only flag on the original createorder was set to true or not)",Kalshi,58,-0.3182
