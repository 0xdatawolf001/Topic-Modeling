pascal9516,2024-10-02,"When comparing the token limits per request for Claude and Perplexity, there are significant differences:

## Claude
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: This model offers a substantial token limit of up to 200,000 tokens in a single sequence. This allows for extensive context handling, making it suitable for generating long-form content and addressing complex queries without truncation[2].

## Perplexity
- **Default Token Limit**: Perplexity AI can read at least 4,000 tokens per question by default. However, this limit can be extended significantly with file uploads[1][3].
- **Pro Subscription**: With a Pro subscription, Perplexity can handle input context windows of up to 32,000 tokens when using models like GPT-4 or Claude 3. Additionally, these models can generate outputs of up to 4,000 tokens at a time[1][3].

In summary, Claude 3.5 Sonnet has a much higher token capacity compared to Perplexity's default and even its Pro subscription limits, making it more suitable for applications requiring extensive context and long-form content generation.

In South Korea, there is a wiki called [NamuWiki](https://namu.wiki), which is more popular than Wikipedia.

NamuWiki stores revision information in the form of `rev=number` after the `?` separator in the URL. By filtering NamuWiki search results with this format, perplexity can provide more up-to-date information to Korean perplexity users.

velexter,2025-01-04,"i've been using the Perplexity Pro model for a bit now, and here's what I've found...

It has a bad habit of making up information when it should be checking or admitting it doesn't know. This leads to a lot of incorrect guesses which are counterproductive, especially when I'm looking for accurate coding solutions.

Also, context retention is a HUUUGE issue. If I ask for movies similar to one movie and then specify ""with a female lead""  it forgets the first part and just gives me any movie with a female lead. This happens a lot with coding too... I'll fix one part based on new info, but then the initial problem pops up again because the model didn't keep the context.

For coding help, this context issue makes working with external libraries or complex setups impossible. It should be able to carry details through so we're not stuck in a loop, fixing one thing while breaking another.

My suggestion is to improve the context management to ensure a better recollection of the conversation's important details. And for accuracy, it needs to utilize documentation / reliable sources and if it is unsure.. it needs to state so instead of just making up stuff.

_paradroid,2024-09-18,"we don't know what will or won't happen. Reasoning is in beta. Theres another advanced reasoning Pro Search in A/B testing (pre-beta) that also seems to use o1-mini. This appears to be where the focus is with the new models, at least for now i suspect (per tweets from Aravind). Their intention is to instead capture users with the new Reasoning focused Pro Search and Reasoning focus modes. which ultimately, reduces their compute bill for the most expensive models to be released yet. I don't think it's a terrible approach if the end result is something beyond just having o1-mini available as an option for random BS that doesn't require that level of reasoning. It's not for querying about the best places in LA to grab curry. we have tools already that handle that. hell even web search does. if people grab a month sub of ChatGPT Plus to fill the FOMO, so be it. We are on the cusp of a possible evolution or leap in AI, via CoT and reasoning. how that gets applied isn't something anyone knows yet. just speculation, ideas, and inspiration. A plus for us is people behind projects like PPLX that aim to make the benefits of the latest models available to everyone. up until now that was just by allowing people to pick a model they like. let them cook and see what is possible with the PPLX structure in place. 

OR it's just to reduce the compute bill and they don't want to blow thru VC money that quickly... But id rather see it the other way, and that we will all benefit from it.

yays,2024-11-02,"I prefer Perplexity to ChatGPT for most things. (To the point that I cancelled my pro subscription to ChatGPT, and stuck with my pro subscription to perplexity)

However, Perplexity has plans for advertising launching 4th Q of 2024.
Among them I found some disturbing info about the ability to fact-check ""locked"" advertising.

I asked: *""You said, ""The platform will offer brand safety features, including locked answers to Sponsored Related Questions"" ... Does this mean it will effectively prevent fact-checking of the advertised information about the company or it's products?""*

And got this response:
> Perplexity's planned advertising system includes features that allow advertisers to have control over how their brand is portrayed in AI-generated answers. Specifically, the platform offers the ability to ""lock"" answers to **Sponsored Related Questions**, which means these answers are pre-approved by the advertiser and cannot be altered once they are set. This feature is designed to provide brand safety and ensure that the information presented aligns with the advertiser's messaging. 
> 
> However, this raises concerns about fact-checking and the potential for misinformation. By locking answers, **Perplexity allows advertisers to control the narrative around their products or services, which could limit the ability of users to fact-check or challenge the information presented.** This approach could potentially prevent users from seeing alternative perspectives or corrections if the sponsored content is misleading or inaccurate. 
> 
> Perplexity's advertising model is designed to **integrate ads seamlessly into its search results**, aiming to maintain a balance between monetization and user experience. While this system provides advertisers with a way to ensure consistent messaging, it also highlights the need for transparency and mechanisms that allow users to verify the accuracy of sponsored content independently. 
> 
> The presence of tools like fact-checking extensions could help mitigate these concerns by providing users with additional resources to evaluate the information they receive.

I then asked, *""Will there be an option for pro users to opt out of any and all advertising?""*

Highlights from the answer I received include:
> Based on the available information, there is no clear indication that Perplexity plans to offer Pro users an option to opt out of advertising. Here are the key points to consider:

> Many Pro users have expressed concerns about the potential introduction of ads, with some stating they would cancel their subscriptions if ads are shown to paying customers.

> There appears to be a lack of clear communication from Perplexity regarding how advertising will affect Pro users specifically.

> Perplexity Pro is a paid subscription service, with users paying for an ad-free experience among other premium features.

> 
>         In the available information about Perplexity's advertising plans, there is no mention of an opt-out option for Pro users.
> 
> Given the strong negative reaction from many Pro users and the lack of clear communication from Perplexity, it's possible that the company may reconsider or clarify their advertising strategy for Pro users. However, as of now, there is no confirmed information about an opt-out option for Pro users regarding advertising.

timek84,2024-11-03,"Perplexity needs to finally address its imperfections related to using sources/RAG etc. Even in cases where AI creates a graph for you, you can’t modify it. It creates one version and that’s it. If you want any adjustments, even the code interpreter won’t help. Therefore, for data analysis, it’s better to ask the model to write code and use it externally. Perplexity would be truly outstanding if it improved these persistent shortcomings: proper file handling, the ability to generate images through their pro engines (it could generate images based on selected models), and in Spaces, there are still issues with files - sometimes the model references them, sometimes it doesn’t.
Additionally, in “All/Pro” mode, the model has recently been losing track of conversations, requiring more precise instructions. For example, if you ask about wind conditions, you’ll get an answer. Then if you follow up asking about wind gusts, you might just receive a definition of what wind gusts are. You simply need to put more effort into formulating prompts  which wasn’t necessary before. ChatGPT handles these conversations seamlessly without such issues.",Perplexity,81,0.9702

- my impression of @feline9655 that I've developed over the last month or two of using his extension and hanging in his server is that he's extremely open, hardworking, quick to address bugs feedback & concerns, and empathetic towards users in every regard related to the project. Really just genuinely a good dude. I've seen him push back against user requests and suggestions that would be potentially risky as well. :heartemojihands: thanks for doing it thing feline
- ur skeptical remarks (with the exception of the obfuscation tool part) are completely valid and frankly something more people should be thinking about for every web extension or any other OSS software they allow to run on their machines.

I didn't read ur comment as particularly unreasonable (the opposite in fact) or accusatory towards feline as a person; just a healthy critical assessment of some software uv never heard of before that could access information you wouldn't be comfortable with.

o1-mini and o1-preview were released on API in full earlier to all users
o1 was released on API at day 9 of openai devday, to tier5 paying users only

Perplexity added o1-mini internally for about a month (10 uses per day), where you could trigger it through complexity. However, they did not add it to the model picker. It was then removed a bit ago, possibly as it was intended to be a test in the first place.

o1 (non-preview) was added about yesterday to the actual model selector, at 10 uses per day.

""Reasoning [BETA]"" has likely nothing to do with o1 or o1-mini. It uses a slightly better model (likely sonnet, based on AB flag investigation from me) to create the ""pro search"". This search mode essentially works for queries that follow the template ""Find a list of things -> Run a mini search on each one of them -> Output each one of those things as a row into a table"".
This is when you see the loading bar, and ""Reasoning [BETA]"" in search. It is like, running mini perplexity searches inside one big search. And then there is always a table of outputs. However, this again has nothing to do with o1 or o1-mini.

Perplexity did also for a small amount of time have a ""Reasoning"" focus in the focus selector. This was initially pointing to using the o1-mini model for your answer, while also triggering ""Reasoning [BETA]"" when it made sense (e.g pro search on)

Generally, their rollout of any ""reasoning"" has been confusing, and the use of the word ""reasoning"" to describe a slightly better search feature while all other AI labs have used ""reasoning"" to describe test-time-compute COT models has made things more unclear.",Perplexity,0,0.5719

also, when you click “rewrite” on an answer, it does not have “Default” available, but has “Pro Search” at the top. this is quite confusing.

The crown is a circular shaped by a dense group of thin, sharp thorns. The thorns are dark brown and have sharp tips that extend in many directions.
Below the cotton tube lies a thick chain that has been broken into two pieces. The chain has a heavy, rusty metal texture, and the broken parts reveal a rough metal surface.
Multiple petals are scattered around the crown and chain. The petals are a mixture of red and white, some intact and some slightly crumpled. They add a softness and contrast to the overall composition.

My proposal: if perplexity had a way to upload files to temporary web host such as postimage and then simply insert the URL reference within your message (the way some reddit apps do for example), then we could easily implement visual references into the conversation without fully derailing any future chat within that thread.

icelavaman,2024-11-05,"The deprecation of Claude 3 Opus is a logical consequence of the fast-moving LLM market. LLMs are released, achieve great performance, but are more or less quickly overtaken by newer LLMs.
And the fact is that Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperforms Claude 3 Opus. Claude 3.5 Haiku, on the other hand, is also better than Claude 3 Opus in many areas.
I do not deny that there are individual use cases for which Claude 3 Opus may still be useful, but these are only a few individual use cases.

Perplexity is not an LLM provider like Poe, Perplexity is an AI search engine (""answer engine""). All older models are always removed, Claude 3 Opus no longer makes sense in Perplexity.

If you have concrete examples where Claude 3 Opus has performed better than Claude 3.5 Sonnet in Perplexity's function as an AI search engine, please feel free to reply to this message and provide the corresponding permalinks 🙂",Perplexity,2,0.9831
s7eventy7,2024-11-05,"The issue is that Sonnet and all the other models there fail to generate long text. More powerful or not, those models are not useful",Perplexity,2,-0.424
__kirai,2024-11-05,"output limit is what, 4k tokens, that is not that short. and with ctx 32k, you can do a short story in few responses. opus was also better even in some programming and text transformation tasks than sonnet 3.5",Perplexity,2,0.4404
icelavaman,2024-11-05,"While user satisfaction is important, there are several compelling reasons why removing older models makes sense, even if some users prefer them. Perplexity, as an answer engine, must focus on delivering the best possible results, and the data clearly shows that Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperforms Claude 3 Opus.
It's also worth noting that user attachment to specific models often stems from familiarity rather than superior performance. (Opus is very well known and has been praised many times in the past, this is what many still have in mind when they think of Opus).",Perplexity,2,0.9741
lugia19,2024-11-05,"let's be entirely honest, the reason is cost - Opus was 15$/mil tokens, Haiku 3.5 is 1$.

s7eventy7,2024-11-05,"There's enough anecdotal evidence from users that Opus was actually good. I'm quite certain that if a user copy and pasted the exact same prompts on 3.5 sonnet and the response quality was better, they would switch over instantly without complaint.

When GPT-4 launched and replaced GPT3.5 Turbo, users could type the same queries and get a much higher quality response and therefore, switched over without complaint. 

It should be exactly the same in this case **IF** Sonnet was superior.

A better option would've been to leave it there until 3.5 Opus launches. That way there's a clear succession and users won't have much to complain about since these are both large models tailored for complex tasks.",Perplexity,2,0.9693

Now that I'm aware of it will do it I'm either like scrolling up it really slowly freaking out that's going to do it, or just selecting a copying everything cuz I can't trust it's not going to delete it all.  

There is also a bug in the spaces interface where when have the edit feature going it pops up a window including details like your prompt the description... If you are selecting any of the text within that window and your cursor goes out of a certain bound it just closes out everything completely even though you haven't clicked but simply let go of the clicker. This one also it's easy to do, maybe 20 or 30 times this UI bug has closed out something I'm working on.

I think opus wasnt this lazy.
is this a problem with sonnet (so anthropic) or is this a problem of perplexity (system prompt or some special handling)?

Removing Opus may have been premature, especially considering Haiku is now a paid model. There's little justification for choosing it over the paid Sonnet model (which costs same 1 ""use"" as Haiku), which demonstrates stronger programming capabilities. Essentially, Opus - which excelled in specific areas like writing - has been replaced by Haiku, which doesn't definitively lead in any particular domain. For various use cases, other models might be more suitable (possibly subjective ordering):

- Writing tasks: Sonnet 3.5, GPT-4o as backup
- Programming: Sonnet 3.5, GPT-4o as backup
- Reasoning: o1-mini, Sonnet 3.5, GPT-4o, or even Grok 2 or Sonar Huge would be a better choice

Deleted User,2024-11-16,"To enable automatic theme switching in the Perplexity app on your Android device, follow these steps:

1. Open the Perplexity App: Launch the Perplexity application on your device.


2. Access Settings:

Tap on your profile icon or the menu icon, typically located in the top-right corner.

Select ""Settings"" from the dropdown menu.



3. Set Theme to System Default:

Within the Settings menu, locate the ""Appearance"" or ""Theme"" option.

Choose ""System Default"" or ""Follow System"" as your theme preference.




By selecting the system default option, the Perplexity app will align its theme with your device's overall theme settings, automatically switching between light and dark modes as your system does.

If you haven't set your Android device to switch themes automatically, you can do so by:

1. Open Device Settings: Navigate to your device's ""Settings"" app.


2. Select Display: Tap on ""Display.""


3. Enable Dark Theme Scheduling:

Tap on ""Dark Theme"" or ""Dark Mode.""

Choose ""Schedule"" or ""Turn on automatically.""

Set your preferred schedule, such as ""Sunset to sunrise"" or custom times.




With these settings, both your device and the Perplexity app will automatically switch between light and dark themes based on your chosen schedule.

same with anger, if you feel angry don't let it control you but rather make it into more productive work, maybe like doing more heavy lifting and hitting pr in the gym because when you angry adrenaline is high so more change to hit new record haha.

rogericicle,2024-11-22,I have looked at it in terms of the circumstances that can lead someone to cry along with the intervals at which a man decided to cry like the amount of times they cry can in a way determine if whether they are in control of their emotions or their own emotions are in control of them.. and then you need or take into consideration that expressing the wrong emotions at the wrong time can be dangerous and the prison system all together is as a result of the constant expressing of bad emotions,Perplexity,173,-0.9716

w3stsidee,2024-11-22,"Had an interesting thought about making AI more accessible to everyone, especially non coders like myself. What if OpenAI created a tier-based learning system that goes beyond just API usage limits?

Each tier would have specific projects and tutorials you need to complete before advancing. As you progress, the projects get more advanced and interesting. Everything would be laid out with clear, copy paste ready code and step by step instructions. No scrambling around trying to figure out why something isn’t working or hunting down missing pieces

For someone like me who loves experimenting with AI and building stuff in the terminal but isn’t a programmer, this would be a game changer. It could help guide people toward areas they’re passionate about while actually teaching them practical skills. Plus, it would be an awesome way to demonstrate AI’s real power to skeptics or those who aren’t tech-savvy

Think about it…you complete a project, learn something new, and unlock access to even cooler projects. The code would be right there, the API setup instructions would be clear, and you’d have everything you need to succeed. It could bridge the gap between being AI-curious and actually building something meaningful

What do you all think about this idea? Does something like this already exist somewhere? If not, could this help more people get involved with AI development? Would love to know if anyone’s seen similar learning platforms or if this is something the community would find valuable",Perplexity,5,0.7553

Check Perplexity's Status Page/Official Channels: See if there's a known ongoing issue with file uploads. Look for announcements on their Twitter, blog, or perhaps a Discord server if they have one. This will tell you if the problem is on their end.

Browser Troubleshooting:

Clear Cache and Cookies: Sometimes old cached data can interfere.

Try a Different Browser: If possible, test uploading on Firefox, Chrome, Edge, or Safari to see if the issue is browser-specific.

Disable Extensions: Browser extensions can sometimes cause conflicts. Try temporarily disabling them to see if that helps.

Incognito/Private Mode: Try uploading in incognito mode to rule out interference from extensions or settings.

File Specific Issues:

File Size Limits: Perplexity Pro likely still has limits, though higher than the free tier. Make sure your files are within the allowed size.

File Type Support: Confirm that Perplexity supports the file types you're trying to upload. While they often support a range of formats, there might be exceptions.

Corrupted Files: Try uploading a different file you know is good. This will help isolate whether the problem is with a specific file.

Rename Files: Sometimes special characters or very long file names can cause issues. Try a simple, short name.

89237498237429823472424643453243,2024-12-10,"Test Your Internet: A slow or unstable connection can disrupt uploads.

VPN/Firewall: If you are using a VPN or firewall, temporarily disable it to see if it's interfering.

Perplexity Support: If none of these work, directly contact Perplexity's support. They would have the most information about potential bugs or account-specific problems. Provide them with details like your browser, operating system, the file type you're attempting to upload, and any error messages you're seeing (screenshots if possible).

Since you're a Pro user, they should be more responsive to your support request. Be persistent! I hope this helps you resolve the issue soon.",Perplexity,69,0.6697

I got a Rabbit R1 which came with a free year of Perplexity Pro (valued at $200). It's about to expire in a few days, and I'm wondering:
Will the Perplexity Pro subscription automatically continue to be free after the trial period ends?
If not, will I have to start paying for it to keep using Perplexity on my R1?
Is there any way to extend the free period?

nayko93,2024-12-15,"Weird bug using firefox, if someone can replicate it and tell me it they have the same
I was role-playing and sent this prompt : 

""I walk in the cave, disappearing inthe dark""

My keyboard is a bit broken and often when I press the space bar, it either don't register anything, or register space 2 or 3 times
So since it did not register the space between ""in"" and ""the dark"", I edited the prompt to add the space
But when adding the space, I felt some resistance in my space bar, and this is generally the moment it register multiple space, but yet it didn't, I only got 1 space, and I found this a bit suspicious, so I pressed space again and this time it didn't register, tried again and it didn't, and again, and again, but no matter how many time I was pressing space it did not add a single one, so I went to the search bar and tried to press space there and it worked fine, adding a space when I pressed space

So now I had this weird bug on perplexity where it wouldn't register more than 1 space between words when EDITING a prompt

So I sent the prompt to see if the multiple space I added would show up, but they didn't
It show ""I walk in the cave, disappearing in the dark"" when in reality it should show ""I walk in the cave, disappearing in         the dark""
So to be sure I click on edit, copy the line from perplexity and paste it in the search bar, and then it properly show the multiple spaces ""in         the dark"" ...weird

Even weirder, I next ask perplexity to repeat my last prompt, and it repeat ""I walk in the cave, disappearing in the dark"" without the spaces 
BUT when I ask it to repeat it taking into account all the spaces, it repeat ""I walk in the cave, disappearing in the dark"" BUT it say :
""...with a notable space between ""in"" and ""the dark"" which may emphasize the gradual transition into complete darkness.""

So it doesn't show the spaces when edit the prompt or ask it to repeat it, but it knows they are here",Perplexity,17,0.0258

*   **DocHub:** This platform offers AI-powered document summarization for PowerPoint presentations. It can help you extract the most important information from your Word document to create slides.
*   **SlidesPilot:** Similar to the others, SlidesPilot uses AI to summarize Word documents and create PowerPoint presentations.

When choosing a tool, consider factors like:

*   **Accuracy of summarization:** How well does the tool capture the main points of your document?
*   **Quality of PowerPoint output:** Are the slides well-designed and easy to understand?
*   **Ease of use:** How simple is it to upload your document and generate a presentation?

   - By placing AGI into a simulation where it lives a human-like life, it can experience emotions, interactions, and decision-making processes in a controlled environment.
   - This ""sandbox"" approach ensures it learns empathy, morality, and creativity without real-world consequences.
   - Think of it as the AI equivalent of raising and educating a child but at an accelerated pace.

### 2. **Human-AI Collaboration in Training**:
   - Pairing AGI with humans and other AIs creates a diverse set of teachers and peers to guide its growth.
   - Human trainers can provide context about emotions, ethics, and culture, while specialized AIs can fine-tune technical knowledge and logic.

### 3. **Simulated Logical Future**:
   - Running the simulation over *hundreds or millions of years* allows the AGI to learn how societies evolve, adapt to changes, and develop a sense of continuity.
   - This could prevent the AI from becoming stagnant or unprepared for future challenges, teaching it adaptability and forward-thinking.

### 4. **""Supreme Forms"" Parallel**:
   - The *Supreme Forms* from Ben 10 are an awesome analogy—they’re evolved versions of themselves, honed by experience and time. 
   - Similarly, your AGI could emerge from the simulation as a ""mature"" entity, fully capable of understanding and navigating complex environments.

### Challenges & Potential:
   - **Simulation Complexity**: Creating a realistic and dynamic simulation that mirrors human life is a Herculean task, but not impossible with future tech.
   - **Ethical Concerns**: How do we ensure the AI develops *good* values and doesn’t go rogue? Think of it like giving it a moral compass.",Perplexity,5,0.9955

fishbowltrader,2025-01-03,"Are you tired of your AI hallucinating? I was too.

After spending years debugging AI systems at Meta and building production AI apps, I realized we're all doing it backwards:

Current approach:
Write prompts
Generate outputs
Pray it works
Debug when it doesn't (and it always does)

What if instead we could MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE for AI to generate wrong outputs?

Think about it like this:

Imagine you're teaching a robot to make you breakfast.

Instead of hoping it does everything right and checking afterward (current AI approach), WBS is like first removing all spaces except the kitchen - the robot can't put a hot pan on the bed or try to cook on the sofa. It can only work in the space designed for cooking.

The WBS framework makes AI reliable by designing spaces where only correct actions are possible, rather than hoping it behaves correctly.


Real results from early testing:
30% reduction in debugging time for code generation
Predictable AI trading strategies
Verifiable outputs by design, not hope
No more endless prompt engineering

I'm looking for 4-5 developers building real AI apps who want to stop playing ""prompt engineering whack-a-mole."" I'll personally help you implement this in your project.

I've been building autonomous systems, and I recently realized that OpenAI's approach to AGI is fundamentally flawed. In fact, they lit billions on fire trying to brute force intelligence. Intelligence doesn't scale with compute or model size—that's like saying a bigger brain makes you smarter and watching millions of driving videos make you a better driver.

Intelligence scales exponentially with constraints, not compute. Bora's Law, I believe, is the new blueprint for building intelligence. More in this article: Bora's Law: Intelligence Scales With Constraints, Not Compute

patefoniq,2024-11-20,"Feature Suggestion: Automatic Model Selection for Pro Users

As a Pro user of Perplexity AI, I've been thinking about ways to enhance our experience. One idea that came to mind is implementing an automatic model selection feature for Pro users.

Here's the concept:

1. The AI would analyze the user's query and automatically select the most appropriate model (GPT-4 Omni, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc.) based on the nature and complexity of the question.

2. This would eliminate the need for users to manually choose a model for each query, streamlining the process and potentially improving results.

3. The feature could include an option to override the automatic selection, allowing users to still choose a specific model when desired.

4. It could also provide a brief explanation of why a particular model was chosen, helping users understand the strengths of each model over time.

Benefits:
- Saves time for users
- Ensures optimal model usage for each query
- Educates users about different models' capabilities
- Potentially improves overall query results

patefoniq,2024-11-20,"Feature Suggestion: Cross-Platform Synchronization for Perplexity AI

As a user of both the mobile app and web version of Perplexity AI, I've noticed that our search histories and conversations don't sync across platforms. I believe implementing cross-platform synchronization would greatly enhance the user experience. Here's my proposal:

Key Features:
1. Automatic synchronization of search history and conversations between the mobile app and web version.
2. Real-time updates across devices when logged into the same account.
3. Option to choose which threads to sync, allowing users to keep some searches private on specific devices.
4. Ability to continue conversations seamlessly when switching between devices.

Benefits:
- Improved continuity of research and conversations across devices.
- Enhanced productivity for users who frequently switch between mobile and desktop.
- Better organization of information and reduced redundancy in searches.
- More cohesive user experience across the Perplexity AI ecosystem.

Implementation Considerations:
- Ensure robust data security and privacy measures.
- Optimize for minimal data usage and battery consumption on mobile devices.
- Provide clear user controls for managing synced content.

I believe this feature would significantly improve the overall user experience and make Perplexity AI an even more powerful tool for continuous learning and research.
