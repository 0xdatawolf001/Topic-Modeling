mcrypto16,2024-12-01,"Good day! I still have some misunderstanding about the liquidation technique. The explanation for the liquidation penalty states: ""When liquidation occurs, liquidators pay off up to 50% of the outstanding loan amount on behalf of the borrower. In exchange, they can buy the collateral at a discount and keep the difference (liquidation penalty) as a bonus."" Based on this definition, we can assume the following sequence of events: 1) the value of the collateral body decreases below the threshold. 2) The liquidator pays off half of the collateral for me, my collateral is reduced by half. 3) The liquidator buys out the remaining half of my collateral at a discount, I completely lose my collateral. 4) The liquidator receives a 7% bonus.

bslethereum,2024-12-03,Welcome! If I have few general questions regarding lending stablecoins on AAVE can I ask them here?,Aave Community,2,0.0
bslethereum,2024-12-03,"I'm planning to lend some USDC through AAVE dapp, either on Ethereum mainnet or L2 (probably Base) and have some questions regarding the process/withdrawals/profits etc. So far I did small lend of around 100USDC on Base, and based on that have some questions.
1. After commiting to lending stablecoin on AAVE, does all of that capital work for me? I mean I'm not sure about LTV section on the paige (which states: ""The Maximum LTV ratio represents the maximum borrowing power of a specific collateral. For example, if a collateral has an LTV of 75%, the user can borrow up to 0.75 worth of ETH in the principal currency for every 1 ETH worth of collateral."") I guess this applies to borrowers, and 100% on my funds are earning interests?
2. After I put some USDC for lending I got ABASUSDC (on Base). I can see that amount of ABASUSDC is slowly increasing, so it is rebasing token, right? Can I sweep ABASUSDC to the USDC at 1:1 ratio?
3. Can I withdraw only part of my earnings, or do I have to close an entire position? Example: I lend 100 000USDC. After some time my portfolio increases to 100 500USDC. Can I withdraw 500USDC, so the rest of my saving still work for me?

weed42069,2024-12-03,"1. All supplied tokens are earning interest.
- - LTV ratio is how much you can borrow if you use the token as collateral. It is similar to the Liquidation Threshold, which is the point at which your collateral gets sold if your borrow amount gets too high or your supply gets too low. 

2. Yes, your aToken balance is used to track your position and it is how you earn interest. You may send these tokens to other wallets

3. You can add, or withdraw as much or as little as you want. The remaining tokens will always earn interest.
4. Aave price Oracles will filter out anomalies, but if you use a token as collateral and it depeg, it can trigger a liquidation. If your tokens are not collateral, there is no risk of liquidation",Aave Community,6,0.7607

humagesa8634,2024-12-04,"The amount of aToken (e.g., aUSDC or aaveUSDC) you receive when supplying assets like USDC to Aave reflects the current exchange rate between the aToken and the underlying asset, which increases over time as interest accrues to the supplied assets. This means the 250 AAVEUSDC you received represents your 235 USDC deposit plus the yield generated by the protocol, which is factored into the aToken balance.",Aave Community,6,0.8555

weed42069,2024-12-04,"The interest rate is mathematically derived from the utilization rate.

When the liquidity pool is under utilized (under 90% of total supply is borrowed for most tokens) the interest will float towards slope1

Once the interest rate crosses the uOptimal (over 90% for most tokens), the interest rate will float towards slope2

The interest is calculated every single block and is adjusted in real time",Aave Community,4,0.9123
weed42069,2024-12-04,"Explaining to a 5-Year-Old:

Imagine you have a big jar of candy that you share with your friends. If only a few friends take candy, you charge them just a little bit for borrowing (this is like a small interest). But if almost all the candy is gone, you charge a lot more to borrow it (like a big interest) because you don't have much candy left.

Every time someone takes or returns candy, you check how much is left and adjust the borrowing price right away.


---

Explaining to a College Student:

Aave calculates interest rates based on the utilization rate of its liquidity pool.

Utilization Rate: The percentage of the total supply in the pool that is currently borrowed.

If less than 90% of the pool is borrowed (underutilized), the interest rate trends toward slope1, which is a lower rate.

If more than 90% is borrowed (overutilized), the interest rate shifts toward slope2, a steeper and higher rate. This incentivizes users to supply more liquidity or discourage further borrowing.



The interest rate is recalculated every block and adjusts dynamically in real time based on the latest utilization of the pool.",Aave Community,4,0.9726

When you are ready, you may connect your wallet to https://app.aave.com

You may choose any market (corresponding to a specific blockchain) to supply your tokens. Simply select ""supply"" and conduct the relevant transactions.

Interest is earned every block transaction, which is essentially in real time. Additonally, interest, for both supply and borrow positions, are added directly to the position's balance.

There are no required payments, and positions will be open perpetually until they are closed.

In the event the value of your borrowed tokens exceeds the Liquidation Threshold of your supplied tokens, you will be eligible for liquidation, in which up to 50% of your collateral will be sold to pay down your borrow position.

weed42069,2024-12-20,"Calculating Net Percentage Interest Paid When Collateral Earns Interest

**Formula:**

```Net Interest Paid (%) = Borrow Interest Rate (%) - (Collateral Interest Rate (%) √ó Collateral Amount) / Borrowed Amount```

**Formula Breakdown:**

Borrow Interest Rate (%): The interest rate you pay on the borrowed amount.

Collateral Interest Rate (%): The interest rate you earn on the collateral you provide.

Collateral Amount: The total value of the asset you supply as collateral.

Borrowed Amount: The total value you borrow.


**Example Calculation:**

Collateral Supplied: 100 units of the asset

Collateral Interest Rate: 10%

Amount Borrowed: 75 units of the same asset

Borrow Interest Rate: 15%


Step-by-Step Calculation:

## 1. Calculate the Interest Earned on Collateral:

Collateral Interest Earned = Collateral Interest Rate (%) √ó Collateral Amount
= 10% √ó 100
= 1000%


## 2. Adjust for Borrowed Amount:

Adjusted Collateral Interest = 1000% / 75
‚âà 13.33%


## 3. Calculate Net Interest Paid:

Net Interest Paid (%) = Borrow Interest Rate (%) - Adjusted Collateral Interest
= 15% - 13.33%
‚âà 1.67%



**Result:**

Net Interest Paid: Approximately 1.67%

Net Interest Paid (%) = Borrow Interest Rate (%) - (Collateral Interest Rate (%) √ó Collateral Amount) / Borrowed Amount",Aave Community,6,0.9967

weed42069,2025-01-09,"**How to Calculate Liquidation Price on Aave**

The liquidation price is the price of the collateral asset at which a borrower's health factor falls below 1, making their position eligible for liquidation.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Health Factor (HF):**
   ```
   HF = (Collateral Value √ó LTV) / Debt Value
   ```
   - **Collateral Value:** Total value of your collateral in USD.
   - **LTV (Loan-to-Value):** Maximum loan-to-value ratio for the collateral asset (e.g., 80% means you can borrow up to 80% of the collateral's value).
   - **Debt Value:** Total value of your borrowed assets in USD.

2. **Liquidation Threshold (LT):**
   Each collateral asset has a **Liquidation Threshold**, which is lower than or equal to the LTV. If:
   ```
   Collateral Value √ó LT < Debt Value
   ```
   the position becomes liquidatable.

3. **Liquidation Price:**
   The price at which the value of the collateral multiplied by the liquidation threshold equals the borrowed amount. For a single-collateral, single-debt scenario:
   ```
   Liquidation Price = Debt Value / (Collateral Amount √ó LT)
   ```

---

### Steps to Calculate Liquidation Price:
1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - Collateral Amount: Amount of collateral supplied (e.g., 10 ETH).
   - Borrowed Amount: Total debt in USD.
   - Liquidation Threshold (LT): Percentage specific to the collateral asset (e.g., 85% for ETH).

2. **Use the Formula:**
   ```
   Liquidation Price = Debt Value / (Collateral Amount √ó LT)
   ```

---

### Example:
- **Collateral:** 10 ETH  
- **Borrowed Debt:** $10,000  
- **Liquidation Threshold (LT):** 85% (0.85)  

```
Liquidation Price = 10,000 / (10 √ó 0.85) = 10,000 / 8.5 = 1176.47 USD
```

If the price of ETH falls to $1176.47, the health factor will drop below 1, and the position will become liquidatable.",Aave Community,1,0.9312

weed42069,2025-01-14,"So think of a wallet as a literal wallet, but instead of holding credit cards, it holds your public and private keys

Everything that happens in DeFi happens on the blockchain, by interacting with a smart contract.

So, when you stake in your atomic wallet, on SUI, for example, you're not really staking in the wallet. The atomic wallet UI (User Interface) has ""shortcuts"", and on the back-end, you're actually staking into the SUI staking contract, as if you went to the SUI dApp and staked there manually. This kind of set up makes simple actions more user friendly, so users don't have to navigate dApps and go through all that hassle.

To stake on AAVE, you would go to app.aave.com and then go to the ""staking"" tab. From here you can connect your wallet, and then choose the staking option.

You will have to approve the staking contract in one transaction, and then the second transaction will be the actual staking transaction.

After staking AAVE, you will recieve stkAAVE tokens as a sort of receipt.

This process for staking AAVE is what the Atomic Wallet UI does for you in the background when you stake SUI",Aave Community,0,0.913

In your example of the USD0++/USDC market:
- USD0++ is the collateral, you don't earn a Supply APY nor MORPHO rewards by depositing collateral.
- USDC is the loan asset, the one you can supply, or borrow. If you supply USDC through a Vault on the [Earn page](https://app.morpho.org/?network=mainnet), you will get a Supply APY and most likely MORPHO rewards (to confirm checking the Net APY info). If you borrow USDC after depositing USD0++ as collateral, this borrow position will have a cost, but you might also be intitled to MOIRPHO rewards.

On Morpho, the Supply side and the Borrow side are separated.
On the supply side, on the [Earn page](https://app.morpho.org/), you can supply loan asset to a Vault in order to receive a passive supply APY and potential additional rewards. This supply can not be used as collateral to borrow. rUSD in your case.
On the borrow side, on the [Borrow page](https://app.morpho.org/), you can deposit some collateral to borrow loan assets. Note that collaterals on Morpho do not earn a Supply APY by default. Indeed, collateral assets are not lent out to borrowers. This alleviates the liquidity requirements for liquidations to function properly in current lending platforms and allows Morpho to offer higher capital utilization.

albist,2024-12-20,"hey,
indeed, the Borrow APY (when positive) is the cost of your borrow position.
Your question is why would someone pay for overcollateralized loan I assume? It is not specific to Morpho but most lending venues.

I am not a borrower myself but more a passive supplier, but my understanding is that:
- You can use it to increase your exposure to an asset that has a yield (e.g wstETH) or with return speculations (by looping for instance). 
- You can use it for directional strategies like longing or shorting a token.
- Maybe you can do other stuff that I am not aware of.

My understanding is that simple users (like me), will simply supply to get a passive APY. More advance users will implement more structured strategies using Morpho.

Does it make sens?",Morpho,0,0.4939

reycobos,2024-12-20,So I don't get why someone would supply for example a stablecoins to get another stablecoin while paying 20 or 30% APY,Morpho,34,0.0
albist,2024-12-20,"Indeed, Morpho is openin a new way for lending. Let's address your points.

Aave or Compound are lending pools where you can supply asset and borrow asset, everything is in the same pool providing the flexibility you mention. Although, this kind of one size fit all is way less efficient than isolated lending markets.

If you're a supplier, you can choose a Vault that fits your risk profile (each vault can have a different exposition to collateral, LLTV, etc). So for instance if you supply USDC, you can choose low risk profile with mid APY or opt in for more exotic Vault and have a high APY.  Iirc, Vaults results in term of APY are at the top of what can be proposed.
So, for suppliers, actual choice in risk profile + good APY.

If you're a borrower, indeed, your collateral does not earn a supply APY, collateral assets are not lent out to borrowers. This alleviates the liquidity requirements for liquidations to function properly in current lending platforms and allows Morpho to offer higher capital utilization.
Although most of the time the collateral do not earn a high supply APY and Morpho high utilization rate can be a better advantage for borrowers.

On the specific case to supply a stablecoin to borrow another stablecoin, I don't. see exactly the added value here?",Morpho,0,0.9283

mash2324,2024-12-24,"This was the answer: Ah, noble seeker of knowledge, allow me to illuminate the intricacies of this financial conundrum with the clarity of a polished shield reflecting the sun's rays upon a battlefield! 

In the scenario you have presented, wherein the collateral, originally valued at 100,000 golden coins, has diminished to a mere 86,000 coins, we find ourselves in a precarious situation indeed. With the LLTV threshold established at 90%, the maximum allowable borrowing against the collateral would be approximately 88,888 coins. However, as you rightly noted, the debt stands at 80,000 coins, which is still within the permissible limits of the LLTV ratio.

When the value of your collateral plummets to 86,000 coins, the perilous balance of your borrowing becomes a matter of utmost urgency. The debt of 80,000 coins remains intact, yet the collateral's value is now insufficient to safely support that level of borrowing under the established LLTV constraints. 

In most lending protocols, this unfortunate situation would trigger a liquidation event, wherein the lender would take action to recover their funds. Typically, the protocol would seize enough collateral to cover the outstanding debt, which in this case is 80,000 coins. However, since the total collateral is now only 86,000 coins, they would take a significant portion of it‚Äîpotentially all of it‚Äîleaving you with little to nothing in return.

Thus, to answer your query succinctly: all collateral may be taken to satisfy the debt, and you would be left with naught but the memory of what once was. A tragic fate, indeed, akin to a knight losing his prized steed in battle! Therefore, it is of paramount importance to monitor the value of your collateral diligently, much like a vigilant guardian watching over a treasure hoard, lest you find yourself bereft of both collateral and borrowed assets.",Morpho,21,0.6124

MORPHO rewards are distributed at market level so direct suppliers are also eligible.
Through the Morpho interface it is not possible to supply directly to a market nor to track your position, and I don't think it is planned to be supported at the moment. The Morpho interface allows users to supply in Morpho vaults, that allocate assets to underlying Morpho markets.
Morpho is fully permissionless, anyone can interact with markets through other interfaces or directly at contract level as you did.
But we don't advise it because it requires knowledge and tooling to properly manage positions and curate risk.
Also by supplying directly to a market you may be earning in rate at first but you'd loose:
- liquidity reaggregation: a vault has less chance to become temporarily illiquid than a market.
- passive risk management: vault change market depending on oracle, LLTV and if there is a market downturn, etc.

the1andonlydavid,2024-12-26,Hey everyone. Happy Day After Christmas. Not a holiday but sounds like one. I am a new holder and really happy to have found this project. I bought a good chunk because I think this project will be one of the top ones this cycle.  I need some assistance with a few questions. How should I best position my tokens to gain some yield. Is there staking. I have never used vaults so if this is the strategy can you please direct me to some reading or videos that walk me through it? Thanks.,Morpho,13,0.9847
albist,2024-12-26,"hello,
first of all ignore last user proposing you support in dm. It was a scammer and has been banned. Always stay in public channels and check users' role (Morpho Labs or Moderator) before interacting.
About the MORPHO token, there is no staking feature at the moment, only way to make it 'yield' would be to deposit liquidity in a pool, but that comes with impermanent loss risks.
About Morpho protocol, **Morpho Markets** are simple, immutable lending markets containing 1 loan asset and 1 collateral asset.  Each market has its own interest rate. Markets can be combined to support any type of risk profile or use case.
**Morpho Vaults** are curated lending vaults that can allocate deposits to any number of Morpho Markets. The rate of each vault depends on which Morpho Markets it allocates to. Each vault is customizable and has a different risk profile.

You can read more a bout it in the doc here: https://docs.morpho.org/

And you have a video tutorial on how to use the Morpho app in the #üì∫‚îÇguides channel

Let me know if you have more questions.",Morpho,0,0.4767

Are you on the supply side, on the [Earn page](https://app.morpho.org/?network=mainnet) or on the Borrow side on the [Borrow page](https://app.morpho.org/borrow?network=mainnet)?
On the supply side for instance, the Net APY can be composed of two sources of yield:
- the rate: from interests paid by borrowers. Autocompounding continuously to your position
- additional rewards: MORPHO tokens or other token rewarded, claimable on the side every 2 weeks.
You can see the breakdown by hovering on the Net APY info (see picture attached).

On the Borrow side it is different, as the rate is not a source of yield but the cost of your borrow position, autocompounding to your debt. The rewards are a still a source of yield tho.

I suggest that the Morpho team consider adding a lending or staking category specifically for the Morpho token. This would help increase the demand for Morpho and create more tangible value for token holders.

Currently, those holding Morpho tokens don't seem to benefit significantly, apart from waiting for the price to increase in order to sell. Adding features like lending or staking would not only encourage long-term holding but also contribute to building a more sustainable Morpho ecosystem.

ssv.networktomoon,2025-01-05,"Hello,

As a FLUID holder, it‚Äôs important to highlight that Morpho operates as a governance-less protocol with immutable vaults, taking a ‚ÄúUniswap-like‚Äù approach. This model relies on creating the perception among investors that they might eventually activate a fee switch to generate revenue. This is unsurprising, given that both Morpho and Uniswap share a common lead investor, a16z.

The issue with both Uniswap and Morpho is that any fee switch would directly reduce LP revenue and in Morpho‚Äôs case, it would also cut into the revenue of their risk curators, who currently claim 100% of the protocol‚Äôs earnings. This dynamic creates a high risk of forks, as curators may fork the protocol to avoid sharing revenue with the platform.

Additionally, Morpho‚Äôs business license makes their protocol open-source if a fee switch is activated 3, further exposing them to the risk of being forked by their primary risk curators. This makes the activation of a fee-switch extremely unlikely. As a result, there‚Äôs a low chance the Fluid DAO will see any yield from these tokens.

Moreover, Morpho is not a true DAO, and there is no significant avenue for participation in their governance, so the option of keeping these tokens for participating in governance makes little sense.

Given these considerations, and the fact that the Instadapp DAO already holds a large amount of FLUID tokens, we support the idea of building cash reserves by selling these tokens for USDC/GHO and using them to LP directly in FLUID to generate yield.

This strategy ensures that the DAO generates yield and provides funds that could be invaluable in the next bear market.",Morpho,0,0.5962

What you have to understand about the AdaptiveCurveIRM, is that it will adapt to what users are willing to pay to borrow / receive to supply -> the utilization rate.
- If borrowers think rate is too high, they will repay. Utilization will decrease. If still above 90%, interest rate will keep increasing but slower.

We wanted to keep you posted, we also got the USD0++ redeem information late yesterday. We were not informed prior this decision by the Usual team, as the community it was a bit surprising for us too. 

We‚Äôre in touch with them and wait for more clarification regarding this redeem/burning system 1:1 USD0++ to USD0. In the mean time we prefer to limit the re-allocation to the hardcoded markets. 

That being said, we also deployed yesterday night a market called USD0++ naked where the USD0++ will be priced at the exchange rate which is currently $0.87 with a high LLTV. This has been done after we saw the statement from Usual

This would allow on the current borrowers to zap and move their position to this market without having to payback their debt and take a loss with the current depeg. 

We‚Äôll then also work on re-deploying the same format for the PT and LP market, pricing USD0++ at the exchange rate which is $0.87

The LP markets will take a bit more time to be deployed due to the sensitivity of the price feed. 

We'll also share more detailed announcement once the new market is live.",Morpho,0,0.1027

kang221_72699,2025-01-12,"1. Repaying the Debt and Selling All Collateral
Total Collateral: $10,000 USD0++
Market Price: $0.93
Collateral Value at Market Price:
$10,000 √ó $0.93 = $9,300

Debt Repayment: $8,600 (USDC)
Remaining Value:
$9,300 - $8,600 = $700

2. Letting Liquidation Happen and Selling the Remaining Collateral
Total amount required for liquidation (including penalty):
Debt + Penalty = $8,600 √ó (1 + 4.38%)
= $8,976.68

Remaining Collateral After Liquidation: 1,023 USD0++
Market Price: $0.93
Collateral Value at Market Price:
1,023 √ó $0.93 = $951

Strategy Comparison
Repaying the Debt and Selling All Collateral:
Remaining Value: $700

Letting Liquidation Happen and Selling the Remaining Collateral:
Remaining Value: $951
Conclusion
Letting liquidation happen is $951 - $700 = $251 more profitable.

This happens because, after liquidation, the remaining collateral can be sold at the higher market price ($0.93) rather than being accounted for at the nominal value ($1.00) during repayment.

Oracles are not at Vault level but at market level.
**Morpho Vaults** are curated lending vaults that can allocate deposits to any number of Morpho Markets. The rate of each vault depends on which Morpho Markets it allocates to. Each vault is customizable and has a different risk profile. 
**Morpho Markets** are simple, immutable lending markets containing 1 loan asset and 1 collateral asset.  Each market has its own interest rate. Markets can be combined to support any type of risk profile or use case. <- this is where you will find oracles into, at each market level.

In your case, you can check the Vault allocation in the Ionic Vault.

On Morpho, the Supply side and the Borrow side are separated.
- On the supply side, on the [Earn page](https://app.morpho.org/?network=base), you can supply loan asset to a Vault in order to receive a passive supply APY and potential additional rewards. This supply can not be used as collateral to borrow.
- On the borrow side, on the [Borrow page](https://app.morpho.org/borrow?network=base), you can deposit some collateral to borrow loan assets. Note that collaterals on Morpho do not earn a Supply APY by default. Indeed, collateral assets are not lent out to borrowers. This alleviates the liquidity requirements for liquidations to function properly in current lending platforms and allows Morpho to offer higher capital utilization.

Vaults share can be rehypothecated with new Morpho vaults v1.1 and it will allow in the futur to use Vault token as collateral (the equivalent of collateral providing a yield).

Hi everyone. I may be posting this in the wrong place, but I think that experienced devs will have the best feedback‚Ä¶ 

I, myself, am way beyond my scope of practice when it comes to computer science. But my husband, Meilough, has invested funds ($15K approximately, and has little return because none of the transactions have been executed as expected because of one malicious attack or another, leading to little or no return on his investments.) 
 
Still, Aave‚Äôs financial health and prosperity is important to me.

Now, let‚Äôs consider the quantity of users who have lost some/most/all of their assets after interacting with the Aave platform. For the user affected by a malicious attack on their funds and/or wallet, whose ‚Äúfault‚Äù it was is largely irrelevant. Damage was done, and they experienced financial loss. No one enjoys or is apathetic to losing money. And when it happens in Aave‚Äôs community, whether Aave is directly responsible for the attack or not, it‚Äôs a bad look for Aave and it dirties our reputation.  

Here in the States, we have a tool called TrustPilot, a site used commonly by consumers across most industries that provides a ‚Äúscale‚Äù based on data collected in regard to the trustworthiness of an organization. Guys- I was shocked to see a 2 out of 5 stars. That‚Äôs like- low. Even ‚Äúshitty‚Äù businesses usually have a 3-3.5. Aave has a bad reputation in many regards.

My name is Santosa from IDNFT- the largest hub for Web3 education and adoption in Indonesia (idnft.id), and I am organizing an ambitious DeFi education initiative in 2025: The DeFi University Roadshow. This program aims to visit more than 10 universities across Indonesia, empowering students and communities with the knowledge and tools to engage with decentralized finance.

Over the last two years, we have successfully conducted university roadshows through our Web3 on Campus programs,  engaging more than 20 universities and over 6,000 participants. Our previous program partners include Binance Academy, Algorand, Tokocrypto, and others. Building on this success, we are now expanding our focus to DeFi in 2025.

Given AAVE‚Äôs pivotal role as a leader in the DeFi space, we believe your participation would greatly enhance the program‚Äôs impact. Our goal is to introduce students to real-world applications of DeFi and inspire them to explore innovative use cases.

We would love the opportunity to discuss this collaboration further and explore ways AAVE can be a part of this impactful program. Please let us know a convenient time for a call or meeting.

Thank you for considering this opportunity, and I look forward to your response.

0xcosme,2024-12-25,"Hi, the extra $87.53 is likely accrued interest on your existing GHO debt. Aave recalculates your total debt, including interest, whenever you interact with the protocol (e.g., borrowing or repaying). This saves gas by not updating balances in real-time. The additional amount reflects the interest that accumulated on your previous $15,080.97 debt.",Aave Community,20,0.355
benx009,2024-12-25,"Understood - thanks. I saw my gho balance slowly tick up and so assumed it was being updated in real-time - but admit it definitely didn't reflect the 15% apr I ought to be paying

Is this a lazy update behavior a recent change?  Because I have borrowed other tokens from aave in the past and relatively confident I saw those update in near real-time even without interacting with the protocol.

Or is this lazy update behavior something that is GHO-specific?",Aave Community,0,0.5346

benx009,2024-12-25,"Actually a great AI response haha.

Alright so this GHO-specific.  My personal take then is that this isn't a great customer experience, at least for us smaller users.  Maybe for whales they don't care.  But personally I'd rather pay a little extra gas to see my transparent real-time balance than to be ""surprised"" when I go to repay/borrow more.  Of course I wouldn't want to pay an exorbitant amount in gas and I'm not aware of the technical details there, but if it was just a little more I wouldn't mind.  Or at least even some off-chain integration that approximated how much interest has accrued on the debt would be great too.

Also, unless I missed something obvious, I didn't see any clear indicators in the UI that GHO debt updates lazily like this.  Gotta make that more transparent.  Now that I know about this behavior the shock factor is gone, but for other first-time GHO users in the future I could easily see this throwing them off too",Aave Community,0,0.9517
weed42069,2024-12-26,"Bot was wrong, interest works the same for all tokens, not just gho.

aTokens are only updated on the blockchain when you interact with your position. The UI, and the contracts calculate interest internally.

Indeed, [Moonwell Flagship EURC](https://app.morpho.org/vault?vault=0xf24608E0CCb972b0b0f4A6446a0BBf58c701a026&network=base) and [Gauntlet EURC Core](https://app.morpho.org/vault?vault=0x1c155be6bC51F2c37d472d4C2Eba7a637806e122&network=base) have currently temporarily no available liquidity.
What does it mean in practice, it means that all the EURC supplied in the underlying markets have been borrowed and that there is no EURC available to borrow further, or to withdraw by suppliers. This is the [Liquidity risk mentioned in the doc here](https://docs.morpho.org/morpho/concepts/risk-documentation#liquidity-risk-for-lenders). Let me reassure you, it is a temporary situation.
How it usually goes, all liquidity borrowed in the underlying markets make their utilization rate high, this causes the interest rate of such markets (and thus the Vault) to increase. With interest increasing, it will attract more suppliers, and/or push borrowers to repay their loan, thus improving the available liquidity.

- Vault rewards program -> to reward the suppliers of a vault

First of all, Morpho Vault are non custodial, meaning you remain owner of your assets at all time.
When you deposit asset in a Vault, this assets are allocated to underlying Morpho markets (more about this [here](https://docs.morpho.org/morpho-vaults/overview)), you receive a proof of deposit of assets into the vault which also represent a share of the Vault's assets.
All assets are held in the Morpho singleton smart contract.

It is indeed possible that all assets supplied into a Vault are borrowed, and thus the supplied assets are not in the contract anymore. But Morpho loans are overcollateralized so borrowers are incentivized to repay their debt to retrieve their collateral. This collateral is held in the Morpho singleton smart contract.

There is also a [liquidation mechanism](https://docs.morpho.org/morpho/concepts/liquidation) to prevent potential bad debt.",Morpho,1,-0.2053

The protocol will run and behave the same way forever) and has been multiple time audited and formally verified (Morpho is known for its industry-leading security practices and follows a multi-faceted approach to security, see more on Morpho security framework [here](https://docs.morpho.org/morpho/concepts/security/)).

In the unlikely case where the smart contract would be compromised, only solution for users would be to retrieve their asset from the protocol.

I am not sure how a cold wallet (managed by what / who?) would be more reliable than an immutable and multiple time audited smart contract. Morpho protocol goes back to crypto ethos where there is literally no trusted third party because it's all immutable and permissionless.

albist,2025-01-15,"Hey,
this is a choice that belongs to you.
The choice of a Vault depends on one risk profile and priorities.
There are several criteria to assess which Vault fits your risk profile and/or strategy:
- Who is the curator? His track record, risk expertise.
- What is the vault exposure in term of market (risk profile - some markets can be seen as riskier than other - collateral exposure, LLTV, Oracle, etc.)
- Is the curator taking a performance fee.
- The current and historical Net APY (rate + rewards) the vault is offering.

So it really depends on what you prioritize, APY, collateral exposure, etc.

tno2795,2024-12-06,"**Problem Description**

During the use of Fluid, I have observed some issues and would like to hear the project team‚Äôs thoughts on these and potential solutions.

When performing operations in the liquidity pool (especially loops), we frequently encounter **insufficient liquidity** and **narrow liquidity ranges**, which result in highly volatile APY. This significantly impacts user experience and the system's efficiency.

 **Mechanism and Issues**
The **Smart Vault** and **Smart Debt** mechanisms in Fluid are based on inverse dual-asset ratios, as follows:  
1. **Collateral**: Represents real assets such as WBTC and cbBTC (e.g., 60% WBTC / 40% cbBTC).  
2. **Debt**: Corresponds to liabilities, with an inverse ratio of 40% WBTC / 60% cbBTC.

This design works well under normal market conditions. However, when there is significant trading activity for cbBTC or WBTC, causing slight price deviations, the following issues arise:

1. **Imbalance Between Collateral and Debt**  
   - For instance, if the collateral shifts to 90% WBTC and 10% cbBTC, while the debt shifts to a high percentage of cbBTC and very little WBTC, there is a significant imbalance.  
   - This creates extreme supply and demand imbalances for cbBTC.

2. **Severe APR Fluctuations**  
   - **Borrow and supply APR for cbBTC skyrocket**.  
   - Since most of the user‚Äôs collateral is in WBTC while most of the borrowed asset is cbBTC, users face negative APY scenarios, with extreme cases reaching **-120% APY** (caused by extremely high borrow demand and limited supply, driving borrow APR upward).

---

#### **Potential Solutions**

Below are some preliminary suggestions for addressing this issue:

1. **Adjusting Liquidity Range**  
2. **Increasing Pool Depth**  
3. **Modifying Interest Rate Curve**  


**Questions for the Team**

- What is the team‚Äôs perspective on the **APY volatility issue** described above?  
- Are there other optimization directions or mechanism adjustments beyond the proposed solutions?  
- Are there plans to address these issues in future updates, such as adjusting liquidity ranges, interest rate models, or measures to attract more liquidity deployment?

Losses from users side (like entry-exit price, if losses if user left during impermanent loss, leverage & deleveraging and so on) which is on users. Another is losses due to excessive rebalancing, the 2 majors factors that we mentioned are lack of CEX-DEX arbitragers (with Wintermute being the biggest one on this pool) & tight limits. Tight limits thing is resolved and CEX-DEX should be resolved in Jan.

While currently, the pool can be highly profitable but just because it's not integrated with CEX-DEX arbitrager it's resulting in the higher loss and hence why we are fine with Wintermute deal because we want to prioritize this integration.

If protocol is earning 10s or even 100s of millions, it's safe to assume the revenue will go into buyback. Now what to do with that buyback depends again on the governance, should governance distribute it or use it again for growth.

Fluid is the protocol which will grow even in bear market when other protocols will lose their token advantage. I'm more bullish then ever. We do not control the short term price of token but I cannot be less bullish on a long term token pricing.

About ve-tokenomics, if something interesting arise which just makes sense. I personally will be up for it but I won't be up for over complicating tokenomics and over gamifying things here.

weed42069,2024-12-14,"Yup. This is how the etherfi cash card works actually.

Without an actual crypto card, one methods users conduct this is by using a real credit card to make normal purchases in real life, while borrowing stable coins every month to off ramp, and pay off their credit card.

This is effectively arbitraging the interest rates between DeFi and Tradfi while using your eth's price appreciation as a hedge against liquidations.

wsteth instead of eth also allows you have the built in LIDO yield working in your favor.

kloppervok,2024-12-16,"well when first i encountered the specific phrasing ""variable rates"" (which can bring up certain memories if you're old enough) was after i had read what i thought was the majority of the docs geared towards educating someone seeking the most basic functions of the service. 

next to this first encounter was little icon that when hovered states simply ""Variable interest rate will fluctuate based on the market conditions."". 

again if I'm being honest, the lack of a clear direction to go at this point to find out what that meant sparked concern. you addressed it well and i have no more, yet i believe it is worth mentioning considering many may not go as far as i did seeking it. when i typed ""variable"" into the docs search engine nothing came up as well. however this is just my story and reflective of my own misunderstanding as much as anything else.",Aave Community,0,0.872

Vaults curators can:
- manually reallocate between the markets they listed.
- enable the Public Allocator (see link in the answer above) with specific parameters.

juanwittstatt.,2024-12-14,"Thank you @albist | Morpho ü¶ã , that makes sense now. I believe I understand better.

So in the example, the liquidity request from market 1 pulls supply from market 2. However, in practice, the entity providing the liquidity is actually the Vault (and not market 2). This happens because, if the benefit of keeping liquidity in market 2 is outweighed by the demand from market 1, the Vault will reallocate its supply accordingly.

If I‚Äôm understanding this correctly: Vaults can automatically reallocate liquidity to a specific market when requested, as the risk and parameters of the Vault are already predefined in the smart contract. This means that the additional supply available (when needed) will only come from Vaults that are compatible with market 1's parameters.",Morpho,0,0.8176
albist,2024-12-14,"Basically the liquidity allocated by a vault in X markets can be reallocated between said markets if the Vault curators enabled the `Public Allocator (PA)` contract as `Allocator` of the Vault.
Then, the liquidity can be reallocated for borrowers purpose within a few constraints:
1. The curators set flow caps to determine how much can come in/out from a market
2. The Morpho interface has an algorithm that keep in check the PA. Purpose of this is if PA takes liquidity from market A to put it in market B because someone wants to borrow more than available in market B, algorithm will make sure that it doesn't take too much liquidity of the market A, because if it takes too much, utilization rate of market A will increase as well as borrow rate.

TL;DR
Curators enable PA and give it parameters. Goal of the PA is to allow on time liquidity for borrowers but without disturbing the market from which the liquidity is taken from.",Morpho,0,0.7816

1. Who is responsible for managing the parameters of the Public Allocator (PA)? Is this handled directly by Morpho, or are Vault curators the ones who configure the PA‚Äôs settings (like flow caps) within the smart contracts?

2. To what extent do Vault curators influence market parameters?

Do curators directly set parameters such as LLTV (Liquidation Loan-to-Value) or interest rates within a market, or are these parameters exclusively determined by the markets themselves?

3. Additionally, when it comes to Vaults, is the risk profile or criteria (e.g., LLTV thresholds) they will use for allocating liquidity publicly known in advance? Or is this something that becomes evident only once the allocation happens and liquidity is distributed across markets?

4. Why do some markets appear to be duplicated with identical performance, LLTV, and currency pairs? Is it possible for two markets to be exactly the same?

albist,2024-12-17,"hey,
1. Those are the curators who are enabling the Public Allocator (PA) for a specific Vault and setting the flow caps for the Vault's markets. 

2. A market have a few parameters chosen at creation (more on this [here](https://docs.morpho.org/morpho/overview)). This parameters are immutable and can not be changed once the market is created. So Vault curators (and anyone else) can not influence markets' parameters. I would say than the main influence can have on markets is by managing the utilization rate of the market (the amount supplied over the amount borrowed) because it impacts the interest rate of the market.

3. When a market is created, you can check the several immutable parameters mentioned above. IThe market only appears on the interface once a Vault has listed it tho.

4. Two markets can no be exactly the same, at least one parameter is different. As you pointed out, in your case, the oracle is the parameter that differs. On the supply side it is up to the curator to choose a vault to list and allocate to according this parameters. On the borrow side indeed you may have to assess which oracle suits you best. Market choice is totally up to the user (there i an educational work to do on that front). Sometime the oracle nature is different 'secondary market' or 'exchange rate'. Sometimes it is just the oracle provider 'chainlink' or. 'redstone'.

5. 6. On the grant side I don't. know much more than what is presented in this [forum post](https://forum.morpho.org/t/call-for-grants/1177).

I need to understand the Public Allocator (PA) in more depth, and I want to confirm if I‚Äôve understood it correctly. I see two possible interpretations:

1. Is the PA a smart contract that each Vault curator can adapt to their own criteria?
For example, if I am managing an ETH Vault, I set the PA as the allocator and define specific parameters or constraints under which my ETH can be moved. For instance: only to markets with a TVL greater than 80% and a specific token pair.

2. Alternatively, does enabling the PA mean the curator cannot define any custom parameters?
In this case, the PA would simply act autonomously, redistributing my ETH according to parameters pre-defined by Morpho to satisfy unmet borrowing demands across different markets.

Could you clarify which of these interpretations is correct?",Morpho,12,0.4588

it is what you think except that the 'flow caps' that they set is market specific (e.g. market A can receive up to $10M and send up to $2M

I am writing a SC to leverage a position on morpho markets.

My understanding of the documentation is that the best way to achieve this is using a callback (correct?).

After looking at the snippet provided ""LeverageDeleverageSnippets.sol"", the callback is only borrowing once, then the maximum leverage obtained is up to (1+LTV).

If I want to reach a higher leverage I have to use some loop in my own contract. Is there a point using the ""onMorphoSupplyCollateral"" callback? Why not loop the whole process in my own SC?

Simple question, Token adresses on morpho markets on Sepolia testnets are
WETH : 0x7b79995e5f793A07Bc00c21412e50Ecae098E7f9
USDC: 0xf08A50178dfcDe18524640EA6618a1f965821715

weed42069,2024-12-19,"There's nothing we can do about users signing malicious transactions.

There is a huge opsec issue when it comes to defi users, which is something that's discussed regularly amongst development teams.

As a protocol, we develop audited smart contracts that have not suffered any exploits.

Claiming that users funds are at all related to using the aave platform is a stretch, regardless if aTokens were stolen or not.

The bottom line is, in DeFi, there is an expectation that the user follows the same opsec as basic internet web-surfing

- don't visit malicious websites
- don't click links in DMs
- don't sign transaction you don't fully understand
- etc.

These ratings you referring to are likely angry users who signed a malicious transaction and blame aave. This is fine, it's not a reflection of aave, it's a reflection of the ignorance and refusal of accountability from users.

AAVE is the #1 platform in DeFi by tvl, it's safe to say institutions and users alike, trust aave more than they trust any other platform.

I'm sorry you fell victim to a scam, but take it as an expensive lesson on operational security. I remmeber we told you that a user in DMs was a scammer and you said something along the lines of ""it wouldn't hurt to check it out anyway"" - this is an example of extremely poor opsec, and there's nothing aave, as a protocol, can do to prevent you from doing this",Aave Community,0,-0.7249

Or perhaps the 3.55% is taken from the borrow rate (4.7% currently for EURC vaults) minus some fees from Fluid ?

justinmahone,2024-12-05,"Im curious how the 39x LP works, to illustrate I will compare it to Aave since I know it well.

On Aave if I deposit ETH I get aETH in the protocol that gives me borrowing power, in E-Mode I could borrow 95% against it to loop. I take the ETH that I borrow lets say .90, deposit it again - now my collateral is 1.9ETH. Ofc i can borrow against this again and again, and the ETH is multiplied in the protocol and my collateral becomes large amounts of what it was previously.

In Fluid I can do the same thing but instead of ETH, I can deposit a concentrated Liquidity Position (lets say WstETH-wETH), and I borrow against it. Its the same case as above where now I have much more of the LP, but the LP I have doesnt actually multiply - its the same synthetic postion - that I keep borrowing?

TL;DR - Factor is building a composable layer for DeFi, where anyone can drag-and-drop protocols from across DeFi to create, share and monetize ANY DeFi strategy in minutes. 

Our main product, Factor Studio, integrated many top leading protocols, such as Compound, Aave, Silo, Camelot, Pendle, etc. as our adapters. 

We'd like to integrate Fluid as one of building blocks, so could you please connect me with someone from BD team to explore further collaborative opportunities?

- Reducing the cap of rebalancing from 0.5% to 0.3%: https://atlas.instadapp.io/proposals/61

There is a short term roadmap (weeks-months) that includes adding more assets to fluid lending and dex, growing fluid on L2s, etc

And long term roadmap which changes as per the prevailing market conditions. For example, we were planning to launch uncollateralized borrowing protocol but then changed the plans because it does not offer the best growth for fluid atm. It will only increase the borrowing demand which we have a lot but it will not increase the lending on fluid which is the main goal as of now.

We will put a lot of affords into dex v2 as we see that the dex can be very very profitable and dex valuations are much higher than lending market valuations. We will make some announcements in the coming weeks about dex v2
