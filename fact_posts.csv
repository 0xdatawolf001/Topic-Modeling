Rather than viewing deformity and disability as negative attributes, this imagery invites us to celebrate the unique stories and experiences that come with them. Just as a deflated balloon retains its vibrant colors and playful spirit, individuals with disabilities often embody strength, creativity, and adaptability in the face of challenges. This perspective encourages a shift in societal attitudes, promoting inclusivity and appreciation for diversity.

They recommended I come here to get a clarification from PM regarding this.

It's obviously clear by the way the rules are written, that this is meant to be a bet on if Luigi's ""first plea"" for any of his charges are guilty. People are attempting to resolve it based on his pleas for the NY state charges without even letting the pleas for the Federal charges happen.

The argument they are trying to make is that it has already been the ""first arraignment""

However, the rules do not say only the ""first arraignment"" counts. The rules say ""first pleas for the arraignment"". First pleas always happen during the arraignment, but the federal arraignment hasn't even happened yet. How can we resolve this market when literally half the charges haven't had a plea yet?

How do I get PM attention so that they can issue a clarification on the matter.

I have a proven track record of successfully delivering projects in the web 3 space, ranging from building dApps for decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to implementing secure smart contracts for various use cases.




One of my recent projects involved developing a decentralized voting application on Ethereum, which required implementing smart contracts for transparent and tamper-resistant voting processes. This experience not only strengthened my proficiency in Solidity programming but also deepened my understanding of blockchain governance mechanisms and decentralized consensus algorithms.





In addition to my technical skills, I am adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams, communicating complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, and adapting to the rapidly evolving landscape of web 3 technologies. I thrive in dynamic environments where innovation is encouraged, and I am eager to contribute my expertise to Jup mission.




I am particularly drawn to Jup because of its reputation for [mention specific aspect of the company that interests you, such as its commitment to decentralization, innovative projects, etc.]. I am impressed by the work your team has done in [mention specific project or initiative if applicable], and I am eager to be part of such a forward-thinking organization.

I am a full stack and blockchain developer with over 7 years of experience in designing, developing, and deploying dApps, smart contracts, and DeFi protocols. My expertise encompasses both front-end and back-end technologies, allowing me to build seamless user experiences while ensuring robust server-side logic.

I have hands-on experience with major blockchain platforms, including Solana and Ethereum. On Ethereum, I have developed complex smart contracts using Solidity, optimizing for gas efficiency and security. I have successfully deployed several DApps that facilitate token swaps, yield farming, and liquidity provision, contributing to real-world projects that enhance user engagement and streamline financial processes.

In addition to my blockchain proficiency, I am well-versed in modern web technologies such as React, Node.js, and Express, enabling me to create responsive and interactive interfaces. My experience includes working with various databases, including MongoDB and PostgreSQL, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval.

As a full-stack and blockchain developer at 1inch.io, I have contributed to the development of the platform's front-end using Next.js and TypeScript, ensuring a user-friendly interface. 
On the back-end, I have implemented server-side logic with Node.js and Go to handle high transaction volumes efficiently. 
Additionally, I have developed and audited smart contracts in Solidity, which are integral to our protocols like the 1inch Aggregation Protocol and Limit Order Protocol, facilitating secure and efficient token swaps across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

Currently, I am seeking new opportunities in Web3 and blockchain development, where I can leverage my skills to contribute to innovative projects and help drive the future of decentralized technology.

Hi guys, I have a quick question with an allowance issue when using CLOB API. For some token IDs (e.g. Will BTC hit 100k in Novmeber - outcome yes) it works just well and I can place an order using the API's function create_order & place_order. 
But for some events, e.g. Brighton vs. Southhampton (token ID for e.g. Draw- yes, 98680452978587690017197865790996313736017409268268892731247810037473667931335), it gives me an error 'py_clob_client.exceptions.PolyApiException: PolyApiException[status_code=400, error_message={'error': 'not enough balance / allowance'}]'.

When I print client.get_balance_allowance() I have an allowance of ~100USDC.e, and my order is 5 shares of 0.15c, and I have around 10$ on the wallet I'm testing. So how come it does not work for some events/token IDs, but works just fine for others? any idea? are there more allowances that I do not know of than for client.get_collateral_address()?

The subgraph data at `gn` shows resolved price of ""0""

But the final outcome is ""No"", per https://polymarket.com/event/will-harris-win-new-jersey-by-10-points

What it's saying is at the current moment, Yes (index 0 in outcomes) resolves to a price point of 0 (index 0 in outcomePrices), and No (index 1 in outcomes) resolves to a price point of 1 (index 1 in outcomePrices).

I think the 70 contract should have covered the 50 contract cost and should have received way more than $28.30 - I feel like I am getting less than break even, I am wondering why my account hasn't been growing this past month it is because of stuff like this This is WRONG.  Please explain and please fix this????",Kalshi,79,0.7351

noahatkalshi,2024-12-04,"Let's say Kalshi has a market on if a coin will land on heads or tails. We know that a coin cannot land on both heads and tails so only one of those will be YES. If I pay 60c for YES shares on heads and 60c for YES shares on tails, I have just entered a losing position.

The coin is flipped and lands on heads. Horray! I just made the 40c in profit from my heads YES trade but I unfortunately lost my tails NO trade (which cost me more than the 40c I made). Now I have lost 20c total because I spent $1.20 on my two YES contracts only to be paid $1 total.",Kalshi,79,-0.6652

And I simply asked “are the funds fdic protected” and they won’t answer. Seems weird thing to say if u won’t answer that Q. And it’s a classic thing people have gotten in trouble for.

brunobowser,2024-12-06,Agreed.  I will add that even FDIC pass through insurance is seemingly worthless at this point - the FDIC has taken Evolve Bank’s side in the Synapse issue (even though Evolve was shown not to have proper controls) and placed it entirely on Synapse by claiming funds were in transit despite explicit approved advertisement by the fintech partners pf FDIC insurance through Evolve.  So no advertisement by a third party around FDIC insurance carries any weight with me anymore.  The FDIC has shown they don’t intend to enforce their rules or uphold their promises.,Kalshi,45,-0.1774
megalodon5423,2024-12-07,"When you deposit money at a bank, you expect the bank to give it back to you. There are two things you might worry about, two sets of risks that might prevent the bank from giving you back your money. One, which we talk about a lot around here, and which is pretty central to the history and theory of banking and bank regulation, is that the bank might lose the money. Banks do not generally just keep your money in the vault. They use it to make loans, so there is risk: The loans might default, or depositors might all demand their money back at once when the bank does not have a lot of ready cash.
These kinds of risk are very well understood, there is an extensive literature about them, they’re in It’s a Wonderful Life, and bank capital and liquidity regulation and prudential supervision are designed to minimize the risk that a bank will lose your money by investing it poorly. And if things do go wrong, there is an extensive system of government backstops — the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s guarantee of bank deposits, etc. — to make sure that depositors will get their money anyway.",Kalshi,45,-0.2431
megalodon5423,2024-12-07,"The other risk, which we talk about less, and which is sort of less intellectually interesting, is that the bank might lose track of the money. You might go to the bank and deposit $100, and the bank might write down “$100” next to your name in its notebook, and then it might spill coffee on the notebook and be unable to read the entry and forget that it owes you the $100. And then you might come back to the bank in a week and ask for your $100 back and the bank might say “who are you? what $100?” And the bank might be totally solvent and have invested your $100 in very safe things, but it won’t give it back to you because it doesn’t have a record of you.

This risk is also heavily regulated, though you hear about it less. That regulation is just less controversial. There are material and debatable trade-offs in bank capital and liquidity regulation: A bank with tons of capital will be safer, but it will also have less capacity to lend to the real economy, so there are debates about what the optimal level of capital should be. Whereas with keeping track of the money, there are fewer trade-offs. Banks should entirely keep track of the money. Nobody is lobbying for “actually bank ledgers should be a bit more loosey-goosey.” The proper amount of losing track of the money is none.

And this risk is harder to fix after the fact. If a bank loses all your money, the FDIC can give you your money back, because the FDIC is the government and can print money. If the bank loses its list of who has the money, what can the FDIC do? You can go to the FDIC and say “that bank owes me $100,” but anyone can say that, whether or not it is true. The definitive list of who the bank owes money is kept by the bank. Unless it isn’t. If the bank doesn’t keep a definitive list, then nobody does.",Kalshi,45,-0.3537

I’m trying to figure out if the Bitcoin & Ethereum price range wagers use 240 of the final 300 seconds prior to 5pm to calculate the final outcome or 180 of the 300 seconds prior to 5pm.  

Here’s what the rules say:

This means that at the expiration date in the rules —Jan 1, a federal holiday, the data from Q4 will still be missing from the site as it is now.    

Can you clarify how settlement will work in that scenario?   Will Kalshi expire and settle the contract BASED ON the information on the CDC website at the moment of expiration?

It’s not the best grammar, but clearly the “infected” dairy cows are infected with the same thing as the poultry - avian influenza a(H5N1). (You can get bird flu from cows lol.)",Kalshi,20,-0.8942

jessa_ipadrehab,2024-11-28,"Scroll up—I pointed out to Kalshi that the top graphic H5N1 is confusing on a CDC Current infection page that Kalshi has decided is generic for H5 and DOES NOT resolve the contract.   The link in the full rules goes to a broken CDC page and not the actual page that will resolve the market.  Also confusing is the actual entity that matters is a CDC page labeled “Past Global Infections” …to resolve a current year question in the US only.  Also confusing is the link Kalshi provided in the summary leads to a Texas page that clearly says there are more than 50 H5N1 infections in the US in 2024.

Kalshi needs to clarify this confusion with a green box or simply refund this market and close it.  

fwiw not all Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) are H5 
not all H5 are H5N1.  Plenty of humans have died from the other HPAI bird flus.   Humans have also been infected (and died) in Asia with H5N6.   The terms are not interchangeable.  

It’s reasonable to assume that  all these US infections are indeed H5N1 because that’s what the US chickens and cows all have. I agree it’s absolutely misleading that the graphic at the top of the CDC current infection page says H5N1 and yet—that page doesn’t resolve the market apparently because the TEXT doesn’t specify H5N1.   That’s not a distinction that it’s reasonable to make and I think crosses a legal line.  I lost money betting on yes because the rules were unclear.",Kalshi,14,-0.8828
drcruse,2024-11-28,"What may be missed here is that the page you are referring to that 'doesn't specify H5N1' used to show both total H5 cases and H5N1 sequenced cases. Kalshi had been using the H5N1 number, and then CDC changed their webpage to only show what had previously been labeled H5 cases. That is why Kalshi shifted to using the other page. I do think Kalshi should have been extremely proactive in clarifying this on the market page beyond what they have done, but the confusion here originated in the CDC changing how they showed the data",Kalshi,14,-0.2967

But the CDC has scientific standards that are not possible or not a priority to meet for some portion of the cow and human H5 infections in order to have statistical confidence that these are H5N1.   They even make this clear on the CDC website by telling us they tried and could not N type some of these.  It was a big enough deal for the CDC to walk back their language over time from H5N1 to H5.   Yes it’s wildly confusing that there’s still a graphic with H5N1 when it should say H5 to match the rest of the site.  Perhaps in a year we will see H5Nx.

This is an argument of semantics.  You think that all H5 infections are automatically H5N1 and don’t require molecular proof.  I think they are likely H5N1 but do require molecular proof.   I think we both agree that this market has been difficult for Kalshi because the original underlying listing H5N1 stopped reporting what we all know is still happening at some level.   I think Kalshi has been as clear as they intend to be on this—H5 will not count, only H5N1 and that is up to the CDC.

Plenty of instances of Google VoIP numbers being hacked. VoIP aren’t safe either. Despite privacy and security being different things, they do go hand-in-hand and I’ve never heard someone say that they’re going to keep things private/secure by signing up for google anything.

Another suggestion is to allow us to delete the SMS Text 2FA even if that means selecting another 2FA method. Literally all 2FA methods are more secure than texting. You could allow security keys (e.g. Yubikey) or a second authenticator app. Even a six or eight digit passcode would be better than texting.",Kalshi,39,0.961

james.kalshi,2024-12-24,"Hi all, we've added a new feature both for API users and website users: Post-only orders! These are orders that will be rejected if they would otherwise cross the spread, so it should make your market-making lives a little easier.

API users can use them by setting the `post_only` flag to true on order submission

Website users have a checkbox they can check!",Kalshi,58,0.2516
bumblingbayesian,2024-12-28,I do not see `post_only` in the documentation for the order objects returned by GetOrders. Is this intentional? I am assuming that the `post_only` attribute cannot be changed with AmendOrder. So it seems to me that API users need to track how `post_only` was set on the original order and cancel the order and recreate it if we want to amend that attribute. Any clues on how we should use this would be appreciated. (cc @Coyote (Kalshi)),Kalshi,58,0.5994
cosmiccoyote0532,2024-12-28,"@James did the implementation of this, so I'll let him correct me if I'm wrong. 

I agree it would probably be reasonable to persist it and return it via API, but ATM that information isn't available because the implementation of this feature didn't require persisting the `postOnly` flag (because it is only used at order creation time). So yes, you are correct you can't change that attribute with AmendOrder.",Kalshi,58,0.7461
lact_09346,2024-12-28,"if i understand correctly... the only scenario in which an AmendOrder could result in immediate execution is if you're modifying the price and it crosses the bid/ask spread.  if you're updating price *away* from the spread, or keeping the same price and just updating qty, AmendOrder should always result in a resting order.  so the cancel/recreate workaround (which i think is slightly racy if the market shifts between the two calls) should only be necessary when increasing (bid) or decreasing (ask) price",Kalshi,58,-0.3134
james.kalshi,2024-12-28,"@Coyote (Kalshi) post_only is not an order attribute, it is an execution attribute (once the order is on the book, it makes no difference if it was post only or not, so we do not store it). You are right, though, that amend order does not take in the post_only flag - this is because post-only on amend would create some inherent ambiguity - would you expect a crossing order to cancel the amended order or to leave it as-is? If there is a strong view one way or another, we can look into implementing the flag there as well, but for now AmendOrder has the same behavior it did before (if the price is amended to cross, the order crosses, regardless of whether the post-only flag on the original createorder was set to true or not)",Kalshi,58,-0.3182
