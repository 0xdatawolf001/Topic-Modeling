lorenzovonmatterhorn9912,2024-11-21,"Fyi, the fact that you try so hard to hide your fees and won't respond to any questions about them is getting pretty annoying. This would be like going to Walmart and giving a $100 bill for your groceries and not knowing how much change you got back. I was pretty active in a market today that on the market page, it showed I made a profit. I went through and tallied up all the fees on the activity page and I actually lost money. Everyone knows that this is a business for you and that you need fees to survive, you don't need to pretend like it's not happening.",Kalshi,0,0.94

Now this code:

```import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

from py_clob_client.client import ClobClient
from py_clob_client.clob_types import BalanceAllowanceParams, ApiCreds
from py_clob_client.constants import POLYGON

load_dotenv()

host = os.getenv(""HOST"")
key = os.getenv(""PK"")
creds = ApiCreds(
    api_key=os.getenv(""CLOB_API_KEY""),
    api_secret=os.getenv(""CLOB_SECRET""),
    api_passphrase=os.getenv(""CLOB_PASS_PHRASE""),
)
chain_id = POLYGON
client = ClobClient(host, key=key, chain_id=chain_id, creds=creds, signature_type=1, funder=""0xb4f36D09fA59Cb4d3e35F5F39A0D12D54CFDaFd7"")

# Check current allowance & balance
params = BalanceAllowanceParams(
    asset_type=""COLLATERAL""
)
balance_allowance = client.get_balance_allowance(params)
print(""Current balance and allowance:"", balance_allowance)
```

Returns this:
