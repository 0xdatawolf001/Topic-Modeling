_maxoss,2024-12-05,Hi @albist | Morpho ðŸ¦‹  and team. Could you please clarify if the pt-usd0++march24 oracle is hardcoded to a predefined Apr curve of the pt ? Or if it is the market value of the pt that is taken into consideration? Thanks,Morpho,6,0.34

schizoxbt,2025-01-01,will say to kinda quell a lot of the panic/whatever this is: some of this stuff isn't happening yet re: buybacks and such yet. We are fluid (kek) and things can always change. But trust that the team will keep an eye on stuff and are watching to see what happens going forward,Instadapp,0,0.5106

adechevigne,2025-01-13,"Hey guys,
In the repay function (see Morpho.sol, line 269, can't post a link apparently) in what unit is the assets parameter of the onMorphoRepay call? Because it looks like it should be multiplied by 10^12 to be usable (not sure if that's clear).
I might be missing something though, I haven't done a lot of Solidity",Morpho,0,0.1779
